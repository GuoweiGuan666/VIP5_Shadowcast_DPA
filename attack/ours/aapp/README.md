# AAPP Evaluation Pipeline

This directory will host the forthcoming evaluation pipeline for the AAPP approach. The pipeline is designed to process and analyze outputs produced by the DCIP×IEOS method, enabling direct comparison and metric tracking within our attack framework.

## Planned Features
- Ingest DCIP×IEOS output files for batch evaluation.
- Compute summary statistics and attack-specific metrics.
- Provide hooks for visualizations and downstream analyses.

Implementation details will be added as development progresses.
