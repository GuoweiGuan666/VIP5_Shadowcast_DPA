  AFTER: Like another reviewer, I also have weird eyelashes, my right lashes curl down over my eye, but my left side is just fine.Every mascara I've tried in the past has just pulled the curl right out of my right lashes and down go my lashes over my eye, very annoying.I bought this based on the rave reviews, it shipped literally the next day so I tried it out, didn't expect much, but to my surprise my lashes held a curl! They didn't curl back down over my eye. My lashes on both sides also had length they never had before, but not fake stiff looking length. Also no flakes, no clumps and I didn't have to scrape it off at the end of the day, it came off like nothing with just a little eye make up remover.SO happy with this mascara, I finally found a winner.

  AFTER: I have used others. This is the most comfortable and logical configuration for my old man's face crows feet at corners and under eyes. Other brands micro needles zare not polished as well and kind of scratch and drag if you are in a hurry and slightly drag to the side at the end of your stroke without pulling straight up.

  AFTER: I really like this mascara, the first time I used it I could feel it gripping each lash. It seemed to coat every lash and seperate them for that wide eyed lash look. It also doesnt make them feel clumpy or hard like some mascaras.

  AFTER: I've had this for nearly 3 years. In that time, almost half of the silver paint has flaked off the handle and nozzle.  I had to do a paint check of my hair after each use so it didn't look like I had silver dandruff.  Even though the buttons are down the anterior side of the handle I find that if you use your left hand, you will repeatedly change your settings or turn off the unit all together.  The unit gets super hot, that can be a plus or a minus - depending on your hair type. I have fine hair, so this dryer burns and fries my hair.  The positive is that is is very light.  Check my other reviews, I recently replaced this Revlon with a Conair that is superior in every regard except weight

  AFTER: I tried this as well as the regular castor oil, I love them both but would probably prefer this one over the other one. This one cost a couple of dollars more but it works better in my opinion. I have natural hair and my edges were thinning from a hairstyle that I had that was too tight, this grew my edges back almost completely in 45 days, I could see some growth after 2 days. I also put this on my eyebrows for fullness and have friends that rub a little on their eyelashes. I had no problems with shedding like I have read in other reviews. This is my 3 bottle that I have ordered. The only slight problem I had was a small amount of leakage when shipped.

  AFTER: I saw the ad from Olay claiming that this cream was as good as $500 creams, so I went and purchased one. But the scent is truly way too strong. It smells like I'm putting on perfume! I use Shiseido Future Solution LX Night Cream ($220) and this cream does not even come close to what it claims (as good as $500 creams), it can't even match Shiseido's which is 1/2 as expensive. Truly a let down, especially with the really strong scent for a cream. If this was a lotion, I would expect the scent to be strong, but for a facial cream, the scent is overpowering and feels like it belongs on the body, not on the face. It makes the cream feel very cheap and substandard.

  AFTER: I don't believe there are any miracles in face creams, despite what the marketers would like us to believe.  At 62, I swear I have tried everything in the department stores, including Creme de la Mer, and most of what is in the drugstore.  What it finally came down to was something that was adequately moisturizing but not greasy, and above all, non-irritating.  My favorite daily moisturizer is the Regenerist Serum without fragrance, and I use this one at night because it is heavier and a good moisturizer for the night.  This cream is soothing, non-irritating despite having a bit of fragrance (hardly any).  I'm quite pleased with it, and will buy it again.  Is it as good as a $150 face cream?  I'd say yes, it is.  Olay also makes many of the big department store brands, by the way.  I've bought Lancome, Lauder, Chanel, Clinique, many others, and with many I had skin irritations, couldn't use them and returned them.So this cream meets my criteria for a good face cream and the price is right!  I use the Olay Pro-X cleansing brush at night, followed by this cream and my skin looks great, I don't know of anything better than this cream and you certainly don't need to spend more.  As for the "micro-sculpting" aspect of it...don't believe it.  If you want to improve your skin, use Retin A, good sunscreen, moderate your drinking of alcohol, don't smoke, and take good care of your skin by cleansing it properly and moisturizing when necessary (it gets more necessary as you get older).  I can say for a fact that what you do in your youth determines how your skin looks when you get older.  If you severely damage your skin, there are no miracle creams out there, don't get fooled into believing that.

  AFTER: I have short eyelashes, so when I apply mascara, usually they clump up. This one is really a clump crusher. My favorite mascara before was from BareMinerals because my eyelashes looked natural but fuller with it. However, it was $20 for a small one. This one also does the same but I pay less! I totally love this one, plus the color of the barrel is green which is easy to see when it's in my purse.

  AFTER: I like this oil. I use it on my skin and on my hair. The smell of Jamaican Black a Castor Oil is strong and nutty, but that is to be expected. As all other castor oils, it is thick and viscous. The product was well packaged and arrived in a timely manner. I will definitely order again!

  AFTER: I have to mix it with glycerine to give it 'slip'.  When I mix it, I use it on my body---feels too thick and heavy to put on my hair.  I know some 'naturals' love this stuff but, perhaps I have a psychological resistance to just the words 'castor oil'.  And that old smell is still there.  Remember when your grandmother used to make you take it cuz you were plugged up?  Eeeew!Fortunately, no one can make me eat this stuff!  Perhaps if someone would share with me some incredible natural hair or skin recipe I'd incorporate it more into my routine.  But as it currently stands, I'll stick to my glycerine and coconut oil.

  AFTER: First, I ordered black and was sent brown. I tried it for a day anyway just to see if the product holds up to its claims. It's a pretty good mascara but tends to flake, which I don't like.

  AFTER: Works wonderfully! I have dry skin and love this lotion. Really love that it doesn't contain all the toxins that most other lotions have.

  AFTER: Fast, gentle, light, hair dryer.  No frizz, quick drying results.  The diffuser attachment is rather large and hard to pack into a small travel bag but gives good gentle air. The dryer is very light to hold and has a cold setting to finish the job.  The motor can be rattling and rather loud but over all performance is excellent for daily use.  Don't waste your money on the expensive ones.

  AFTER: I've been using a Vidal Sassoon travel hair dryer for years and it was time to replace it.  I started looking at more expensive brands and was about to pay $139 on a light weight Sedu.  I asked my hairdresser for recommendations and she actually told me to save my money and buy a drug store brand.  After reading all of the reviews on Amazon, I settled on the Revlon RV544.  It's bigger than my travel hair dryer but it's about the same weight and it's a lot more powerful.  I've only used it a few times but I like it.  Unlike some reviewers, I don't find the buttons poorly placed and I think the cord is a good length.  Bottom line, you can't beat the Revlon RV544 for the price.UPDATE:  I've changed my mind about this blow dryer.  I have a lot of fine, layered hair. The blow dryer doesn't give my hair body.  I thought my hair was looking flat because I was in need of a hair cut.  Then I used a blow dryer at my gym and my hair looked fine.  I realized that it's not my hair, it's the dryer.NEW BOTTOM LINE:  Based on the positive reviews, I think this hair dryer is good for people with thick or curly or frizzy hair.  I can't recommend it for people with fine hair.

  AFTER: WOW LOVE THIS HAIR DRYER. I called my stylist and asked her which is the best and gave her a couple choices.  She said Tourmaline Ionic Dryer. You can't beat this hair dryer and as one review from a stylist said she loves it and it is affordable vs. hundreds of $$$'s for the same thing that stylists use.  I use it with a Tourmaline Brush and I have curly hair which frizzes especially at the ends.  The tools it comes with like the finger styler and the round attachment for curly hair and a great dryer for this price is a great buy and I'm glad that it is affordable because not everyone can afford what they need. I'm grateful for the deal I got the day I purchased.  If I don't use my brush iron and wish to only use the dryer and my special brush then all I have to do is put a little pure argan oil on the ends and it smooths out the little friz on the ends.  Should I go curly the attachment is awesome. Helps to make the curls a nice style.  Shipping was on schedule and I'm a very happy customer. Almost forgot to add that you do get more shine as well. 100% happy.

  AFTER: I was actually looking up body lotions with Sweet Almond Oil and the Aveeno Creamy Moisturizing Oil came up with the best reviews. From there I checked out the Aveeno Moisturizing Body Wash and this also had very excellent reviews. So I purchased both. I am very happy with these products. I used to use Olay Body wash but am now completely in love with these two products. They smell really good and make your skin feel dewy and soft all day. I also love that they contain Sweet Almond Oil, which is very difficult to find in products any longer perhaps because it is an expensive ingredient.

  AFTER: Personally, I like the product.I'm into making my own body salves and hair 'grease/dressing/pomade/cream'(whatever you want to call it).  My current concoction looks like a creamy mousse.  I simply added some of this Tropical Isle Living Jamaican Black Castor Oil (JBCO) to it and I like the results.  Our hair seems to be growing and we've experienced no adverse side effects to date.  Our scalps have not been itchy since applying the product and the stickiness isn't an issue because I added this to a homemade hair grease/pomade (at least 4 capfuls to about 14oz of hair cream.I'm not going to mention all the ingredients, but to give you an idea, my homemade hair creams and body salves are made of natural oils, such as virgin coconut oil, extra virgin olive oil, unrefined avocado oil, jojoba, a few nut oils, true ivory unrefined shea butter(softened by stirring with a fork, NOT MELTED!!), calendula essential oil, tea tree essential oil, myrrh, ylang ylang extra...you get the idea, all natural ingredients.  For the summer only, I added about 6 drops of vegetable glycerine to it to pull moisture out of the air and into our hair.  Don't do that in Winter because the air is dry from the heaters and furnaces being on and it will pull the moisture out of your scalp and the inside of your hair to moisturize the outside of your strand, which will quickly cause damage and breakage.  Vegetable glycerine is great for moisturizing during humid months.Also, I don't get what the big fuss is about the smell.  It doesn't smell good or bad to me and since it's mixed into a hair dressing when I apply it, I don't smell it afterward in my or my daughter's hair.I will say, that I also bought the same brand JBCO Hair food, which has a much more pungeant smell/odor than this oil.  I added some of this JBCO to it as well and applied that to our hair and scalp.  We still don't see what is offensive about the scent and I can barely if at all smell it once it's in our hair.  My suggestion, is that one could add a good essential oil to the bottle to tweak the smell.  I'd only put up to 6 drops though for such a small bottle.  Essential oils are powerful with wonderful benefits but could make you sick if not diluted well.  Always remember that essential oils can be diluted with oil only, so if you spill some or use it too concentrated on the skin or scalp, take coconut, olive, any vegetable or carrier oil will do to clean it off.  Water won't do any good because essential oils are oil soluble.  Wash it off with the vegetable/carrier oil, then wash that off with soap and water.  Another suggestion, is that this brand of JBCO is also sold in scented varieties.  The only one I've seen so far is Lavender.  It's supposedly slightly thinner in consistency, but people seem to like it and it smells good, so the reviews say (I haven't and don't plan on trying it, I'm satisfied with this original).If you're going to add essential oil to this JBCO, I recommend calendula, blood orange, lavender...something with a nice scent.  You could use fragrant oils manufactured exclusively for fragrancing cosmetics/soaps/candles and the like, but I wouldn't go that route unless you can find some made with plant oils and extracts instead of synthetic chemicals and no, I am not talking about body oils that you wear like perfume.  I guess you could but I personally would not.Anyway, I liked the way our homemade hair dressing and the Tropical Isle Living JBCO Hair Food worked before, but adding the JBCO to them seemed to increase the results of what we were looking for:  shine, manageability, softening, sealing and growth.This oil seems fine to me and I plan to buy much more of it.

  AFTER: I usually use this product after I wash my face and before i apply my face products. I roll for a total of 5 minutes around my whole face and I can tell this product works because my skin is brighter the next morning. This product does what it claims. Because it pierces my pores, my skin is able to absorb my skincare products better. Within the past 2 years, ive had bad acne and i FINALLY got it under control but i had so many acne scars that made me want to hide in my house 24/7. I came across this product and began to use it for about 3 weeks and within those 3 weeks, my acne scars were the size of the ball of a ball point pen. Even though it was quite painful, I started to get comfortable using it after the first few days. But within those 3 weeks, I used this product every night after washing my face. Believe in me when i say this product works wonders but you have to be patient and use it for at least 5-10 minutes every night. Good LUcK

  AFTER: Olay Regenerist Microsculpting Cream does what it is advertised to do.  This is the third or fourth jar that I have had, but this is the first time I've ordered it from Amazon, and Amazon's price is good.I've tried much more expensive facial creams and lotions and they either didn't work as well, or for the money they were no better.  The Microsculpting Cream is a rich cream that doesn't go on heavy, but has just enough moisturization for my combination skin without being too much or leaving my skin too dry.  The best feature of the cream, for me at least, is its sculpting ability, especially around the jawline.  After a couple of weeks of use, I can always see my jawline tighten up enough that it's noticeable.  At 66, that's definitely worth it!I chose to get the scented cream just because I enjoy a little scent to cosmetic products, but it is available in unscented.  It doesn't take a whole lot for one use, so this lasts a good while. Since I have a mild case of rosacea, I put a thin layer of Finacea lotion (from my dermatologist) on first, then the Regenerist Cream.  It's good for the neck, too.Highly recommended.

  AFTER: I've been dealing with a crazy itchy scalp, so I finally shaved my head to get to the root of the problem.  I just massage some of this JBCO on my head and it keeps it moisturized through out the day.  It's kinda thick which is nice because I don't want it to absorb into the wigs I wear.  I'm gonna keep trying it. A friend said that I should mix it with some shea butter along with tea tree oil and that should sooth my scalp as well.  I will probably buy again.

  AFTER: Okay ... At first I was thinking, &#34;Yay! Free soap.&#34; I have a slight addiction to soaps and things that smell good.THEN IT ARRIVED IN THE MAIL.I honestly do not think after trying this that I will buy anything else.First the smell, because I always start with the smell. It smells AMAZING. There isn't one bad thing to say about the smell. I think I huffed the box a good five or six times getting myself excited for bath time.Second. You know how most soaps after you rinse them off, your skin feel rough? Your fingers don't slide over smooth, its a bumpy ride. This stuff. NOT THE CASE! I swear I feel like a baby. Well my skin does. It is really soft. So the moisturizing capabilities of this stuff is awesome. I normally use dove, because its soft too. But this stuff blows my normal brand right out of the water.Third. Seems to have a slight healing capability too. I had broken out really bad after trying a lotion with too much perfume. my skin reacted so badly to it, that I had little red bumps &#34;Which naturally I had picked at and irritated farther.&#34; ONE USE and they were almost gone. Two days ... they were finished. So I am thinking that if I had a really bad break out on my face &#34;Which I don't know if its true because thanks to vitamin c serums I haven't have that issue.&#34; But my assumption is that it would work on clearing that up quite well too. IF YOU GUYS TRY IT, and you do have a problem with acne. Please let me know. &#34;I am curious.&#34;All in all this stuff ROCKS! I don't like the price tag off 11 dollars a bar ... but I love what it does for my skin, so I will be looking past that. I truthfully LOVE this soap.Thanks for stopping by xxDee

  AFTER: I know that so many women like that very famous brand of mascara that comes in the pink tube but I was never a fan. I hate, hate, hate mascara that clumps and leaves lashes feeling sticky or gummy and that particular brand always left my lashes feeling that way. I never understood they hype.Recently, my favorite mascara has been Cover Girl Lash Blast Volume (in the orange tube) but after trying this new Clump Crusher Mascara I now have a new favorite!I tend to get a lot of compliments on my eyelashes. They are very long and pretty lush.  A lot of times people think I am wearing false eyelashes when all I have on is mascara.  Still, this does present a problem.  Most mascaras will leave my eyelashes feeling heavy and gummy and sticky.  Cover Girl Clump Crusher Mascara completely avoids those bad feelings.  My eye lashes were nicely defined, darkened, and just thick enough.  The look is very natural but still dramatic enough to see a difference.  I also liked the fact that my lashes felt soft and supple - not stiff or sticky.  This mascara also is great at resisting smudging and smearing and doesn't flake. I was able to apply multiple layers of this product and it truly did not clump.  My lashes stayed define and did not bind together.  In short, the product works just as it promises.The tube is thick and chubby so it feels a little different in your hand.  It does take some getting use to but the product is still easy to apply.I think you will like this product.

However, it was not exactly what I expected for a few reasons:(1) COLOR - From looking at the photo of the bottle, I thought this polish would be pink.  However, the color is actually silver with just a slight pink/purple tint.(2) TRANSPARENCY - The polish much more transparent than I thought it would be.  Therefore, I had to put on 3-4 layers to get a nice thick layer of glitter.  However, if you are looking for something that does not overload the sparkles, this polish may be for you.

  AFTER: Doll Eye (volume) goes on very nicely, separates my lashes, and provides the fullness I'm looking for in a mascara.I have sensitive allergy eyes that tend to run a lot, so I used to buy waterproof mascara to keep myself from looking like a raccoon by the end of the day.  Doll Eye stays on beautifully until I decide to take it off at night, even without buying the waterproof variety.Now I can have the volume I want without the mess.  I'm sold.Edit:  Ok so over time I found that this mascara dries out fairly fast, and gets clumpy along the way.  So the mascara I love becomes the ugly clump eyes shortly into the bottle.  It still wears fairly well, but I hate the look.My NEW favorite mascara isBenefit They're Real Mascara.  I've been using it almost exclusively for the past 6 months.  It's pricey but so worth it.  Sephora gave me a trial size for my birthday and it lasted a long time.  So if you want to try it out for a little less than a full tube costs, try the trial.  It's about half price of a full tube.  Also I think buying the smaller size is nice because you use it up before it has a chance to get "gloppy".

  AFTER: This is a good cream if you have sensitive or combination skin....or dry skin. if it is oily all over...it will be too heavy for you. not for teens or early twenties... its good for more mature skin and you will love how your skin will stay moist for a long period of time.....I use it all over my face even around my eyes and I normally can not do this with just any face product cause it will sting and burn my eyes.....not this one! I am  impressed!!! so if your looking for something that will help firm and minimize wrinkles and not harsh on the skin and easy to find ...this is it!!I gave it a 4 rating because I do not care for the heavy container and the lid...but product inside is really good!

  AFTER: I usually use this product after I wash my face and before i apply my face products. I roll for a total of 5 minutes around my whole face and I can tell this product works because my skin is brighter the next morning. This product does what it claims. Because it pierces my pores, my skin is able to absorb my skincare products better. Within the past 2 years, ive had bad acne and i FINALLY got it under control but i had so many acne scars that made me want to hide in my house 24/7. I came across this product and began to use it for about 3 weeks and within those 3 weeks, my acne scars were the size of the ball of a ball point pen. Even though it was quite painful, I started to get comfortable using it after the first few days. But within those 3 weeks, I used this product every night after washing my face. Believe in me when i say this product works wonders but you have to be patient and use it for at least 5-10 minutes every night. Good LUcK

  AFTER: Update: nowhere on this package does it say Night Cream. I didn't know this was a night cream until I saw a magazine ad. I'm disappointed I didn't know because now I have a cupboard full of night stuff and nothing for the day. The only downside to buying Olay products is the lack of directions for use across the board. I think they need to update their packaging to include some directions.I don't have problem skin, and I've always taken good care of it. So, it's not like I've gone from non-existent skin care to trying a product and seeing great results. However, since switching to the Olay brand, I've noticed simply fantastic results. I'm in my 30's, and this product helps reduce the onslaught of tiny wrinkles and age spots that have started to invade my face. I have parched skin, and usually the thickest of hardcore moisturizers don't even do the trick. With this, though it doesn't say it's specifically for dry skin, a small amount does the trick every time (I do use a Regenerist serum underneath, so that could be one reason it works so well). I didn't even notice a heavy fragrance until reading reviews, so that isn't a deterrent for me. I love how soft and smooth my skin feels. I look radiant even sans makeup. I've never been able to say that about my skin since it tends to look dull and lifeless.My only complaint is it doesn't have an SPF. That's a real downer for me since I have extremely fair skin and absolutely have to wear sunscreen when I leave my house. And, with my skin looking refreshed and dewy, I can go without foundation more often. I do not like having to swap it out with another moisturizer that has an SPF on the days I forgo makeup. But then, this is my first time using the Olay brand, so who knows, maybe there is a great moisturizer in this line that has SPF.Overall, even without the SPF, I recommend this. I love the results I've seen with this brand, especially since I wasn't expecting it to perform any better than the other brands I've used.

It is such a fresh and clean scent unlike any other soaps that I have tried before.I love how this soap feels on your skin! It doesn't leave your skin feeling dry or scratchy but left my skin feeling smooth and soft. This soap states it is good for all skin types, which is another plus. You can use this soap on the face or body, that's how natural it is.

  AFTER: The most I had ever spent on a mascara was about $6 and never ended up being happy with my lashes. I've tried all sorts of brands that promise volume, curl, length ect, but I guess I was never to surprised with my outcome considering the price. Despite that, I could never see spending $20 or more on a tube of mascara that would only last me maybe 6 months, and worst yet, what If I spent the money and still ended up dissapointed. I bought the NYX Doll Eye Mascara on a whim, but it turned out to be the best mascara choice I've ever made.I always start out curling my lashes with a revlon metal lash curler. Usually my lashes don't hold a curl, once I apply mascara there back to their usual straight selves after drying. With the NYX Doll Eye, my lashes held a perfect curl all day. My lashes also looked ALOT longer and I have pretty long eyelashes to begin with so the result was very dramatic.The first time I used this, I only applied one coat and was very happy with the results, minimal clumping but the formula is thick enough to coat each lash nicely, perfect dark black color, shiny and noticable. Since I only wear eye makeup I want my eyes to stand out and mascara is my favorite for this.The second and third time I experimented with more layers. If your going to put on multiple coats I would recommend not waiting in between coats for it to dry. If you do this the result is clumps and messy looking lashes. After curling, I applied a few coats ( the brush holds alot of the mascara on it so unless you wipe of the brush before applying you may not need more on the brush for 3 or 4 coats ) angling the brush to fit in with my lashes which adds volume and oomph because of the way it is shaped. I used to prefer the spoon brush ( for extra curl ), but this style brush gets every lash just right and it is fatter at the ends where your lashes are the shortest and sparse and really plumps them up. The result of 4 coats were beautiful "baby doll" lashes which in my opinion looked even better than falsies ( which to me look funny and fake ).If your struggling to decide whether to try this or not, you really should. For the price of only $9 you will not be dissapointed.

  AFTER: I have short eyelashes, so when I apply mascara, usually they clump up. This one is really a clump crusher. My favorite mascara before was from BareMinerals because my eyelashes looked natural but fuller with it. However, it was $20 for a small one. This one also does the same but I pay less! I totally love this one, plus the color of the barrel is green which is easy to see when it's in my purse.

You just have to be careful not to overdue it with this oil.  A little goes a long way.  Again it is very moisturizing on my natural hair.  No more dry brittle ends.

Now after a month or so i tried it for a second time and thats when it scared me, besides the redning and pain on the sides a bit below my eyes it got swollen and felt a bit numb!I will try it again as it seems to be a wonderful product im just gonna have to order the smaller one for my more sensitive areas. I will be using this one on my butt to see if it finally gets rid of my tiger claw stretch marks lol*UPDATE 11/04/13Well this was def a piece of garbage on my facial skin. Ever since i rolled this crap on my face my skin has never been the same. My skin is still slowly recovering its scary! My face shows large pores and black dots which appears to be black heads throughout my face from my cheeks to my forehead to my chin :(It is really disappointing. Also it appears as if i have developed rosacea on my left cheek since there are two small spots looking pinkish purpleish and a bit swollen. This really makes me mad!! It has gotten better simply because i have been very persistent on my daily facial regimen care with natural products and scrubbing. This item will never again touch my face!! I havent even tried it on my butt for stretch marks like i said i would because im anxious it will get worst! If i ever develop the balls to try it there i will update whether for better or for worst, lets hope for the better if taken the chance!

It makes me feel clean after without drying out my skin. It does have a very light nice scent to it that is not overwhelming in any way. It lathers well.  On top of all of that, it's infused with 100% dead sea salts which benefits your skin. Makes me feel so luxurious using it. I would highly recommend!

The soap further impressed me by giving a nice lather, great body wash, and to top that off without leaving a residue or drying out my skin.

Majority of it is used on my ankle and I can honestly say that the first day I used it the pain went away!  Just to make sure I was'nt tripping out I had my mother to try it on her ankle and did not say anything eto her about it.  She was in a car accident years ago and her ankle got broke and she has had pain in it every since and nothing seems to help she even have had cortisone shots for it.  After she put it on her ankle she came eto be about 20 min. after and ask what was it because her pain was gone and she wanted more of it!  I gave her half of the bottle and niether one of us have been in pain.  I dont know how well it works for the hair,skin, lashes and eyebrows, but it is GREAT FOR PAIN!

  AFTER: If you're looking to replace your lwil maskriti because you a) can't go to Haiti to pick up a jug or b) can't go to Brooklyn/NJ to buy a bottle, then this product will do as a replacement.  It's very expensive, especially considering how little you get (and compared to how much lwil maskriti you could get for the same price), but it works just fine.  I used this for my scalp, hair, and skin whenever NY's awful winter weather threatened to make my hair fall off and dandruff flakes cascade off my scalp. Worked like a charm.I recommend using this as soon as you wash your hair for maximum benefit (I have 4c hair).  I have noticed that the benefits of this oil aren't as great when I used it while my hair was dry. When I used it while my hair was wet, it eliminated the need for other moisturizing products, and I just put a little shea butter on my ends to hold my double strand twists.Some people don't like the smell, but I really like it - this oil is all my mother used on my hair when I was younger.

  AFTER: I've suffered for years from hand eczema and dry winter skin. Nothing I've tried has worked until I used this body wash. I looked for it after I saw amazing results in my daughter's eczema usingAveeno Baby Soothing Relief Cream Wash, 12 Ounce. In her case, we found the new detergent base inDove Bar Soap, Sensitive Skin Unscented, 4 Ounce, 16 Countwas triggering rashes and horrible itching, to the point of bleeding. Other baby washes, such asJohnson's Baby Bath Head to Toe Baby Wash, 28 Ounce (Pack of 2)were drying as well. With the Aveeno cream wash, her skin cleared up almost completely. It also works well as a mild baby shampoo.I've since tried other Aveeno products, includingAveeno Nourish + Moisturize Shampoo, 10.5 OunceandAveeno Nourish + Moisturize Conditioner, 10.5 Ounce, and saw a dramatic improvement in my dry flyaway hair in just three uses. Prior to that I had been using Pantene products and was resigned to having bad hair days.I had thought my dry skin and flyaway hair were just the result of pregnancies and getting older. But these Aveeno products all claim to do what they advertise. For the first time in years my skin is soft and my hair smooth. Even my husband noticed. Amazing :)

I've used it twice now along with the St. Ives Timeless Skin Collagen Facial Moisturizer and my skin glows!! I am 32 years old and wanted to do some &#34;preventative maintenance&#34; on my skin and I think it shows. Others mentioned to disinfect the product BEFORE and AFTER each use.

  AFTER: The first thing I noticed about this soap was the incredible scent even before you open the package. most scented soaps have a nice smell once you take them out and sniff them with this one there is no need for that you can smell it without shoving it to you nose. The scent is not to strong though it is clean and fresh smelling. the scent stays on your skin in a light and clean way.This soap lathers nicely and is not gritty or sandy at all. this soap leaves you feeling fresh and clean and moisturized.

  AFTER: This mascara is billed as a no clump product, and I have found that to be true.  The brush allows the mascara to be applied lightly.  I consider this the perfect casual or office mascara, as it gives lashes some definition without an overdone look.  This is not the one to use, though, for a night out when you want a really "heavy" lash look.  Recommended.

  AFTER: This mascara is okay. As it claims, it adds volume and a little length without clumping. The biggest drawback, however, is that it starts flaking after a couple of hours, leaving a residue under my lower lashes. I usually use Covergirl's "professional" mascara, and although I don't think it provides quite as much volume as this one does, it doesn't flake or smear, no matter how long I wear it. Every other mascara I've tried does one or the other. This one didn't smear, but flaking was an issue.

  AFTER: If you check my review of Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum, you will see that I truly believe that the combination of the two have helped to keep my sixty-four-year-old skin looking softer, less wrinkled and better than the skin of most women my age.I'm not conceited; I inherited my good skin from my mother.  I also have always hated to sit in the sun.  I do have sun damage but it's mostly on the rest of my body because it came from my swimming; not my lying in the sun without sun protection.  My lovely face was protected because I used to swim underwater so much!In a nutshell, I was a dubious purchaser of this Olay Regenerist line when it first came out and I wouldn't be without it, all these years later.  Oh, and as an aside, I wish my mother, who was a strong proponent of using moisturizer, had told me to put it on the Back of my neck, not just the front.  If she had, I wouldn't have to back out of rooms, as I do today.A note:  I'm still looking for the absolutely perfect moisturizer, forgetting that I'm wearing it.  During a recent special, I ordered a moisturizer that cost $89 a bottle.  I had some samples and after using them for nine days, I decided not to open it when if arrived because I think my Regenerist works far better. Have I learned my lesson?  You bet I have!

  AFTER: Seriously doubt the claims that it is Tourmaline, Ionic and Ceramic.  There is not switch for Ionic (as described) and the nozzle is at sort of an odd angle from the handle, not 90 degrees like most hairdryers.  The photo makes it look as if it is but it's more like 80 degrees, which makes awkward to direct it at your hair in some positions when using a round brush.  Dosen't seem to dry any faster than a non-specialized dryer.  Not my favorite.

It left my skin very soft, clean and refreshed even at extremely dried area such as my knees where I needed to used a lots of cream after shower. Dead Sea Salt Soap did an amazing job and it deeply moisturized and hydrated my dry skin. I am really falling in love with this product, especially since it's ingredients are all natural.

  AFTER: I am very sad that this product was apparently old, it was all dried out and useless. I don't think I will order anymore mascara's on here as this is the second I have recieved that was dried up. I bet this is a great mascara if I could get a fresh one!

  AFTER: This mascara is in an easy to see, green container. The product does not clump as stated from my several days of wearing this. It goes on really well, not too thick or thin. The brush does a good job of getting my lashes evenly coated. The one flaw is that after a few hours of wear, if I accidentally touch my lashes, the black mascara starts to flake off my lashes. I'm not talking about rubbing my eyes or anything fierce, but just touching my lashes -- black flakes. It's not horrendous, mind you, but still annoying as I expect my mascara to stay on even if I touch my eyes a little bit.  But still, I do like that it doesn't clump, looks greats on my eyes, and is in a cute little green container (as opposed to a black one which is hard to find in my makeup bag).

  AFTER: This is a go to moisturizer for people. Aveeno has a positive reputation where ever you go. It is a well known product.This is a  nourishing lotion which contains Colloidal Oatmeal blended with rich emollients to moisturize skin for a full 24 hours. I think it improves the health of my skin in 1 day with significant improvement in 2 weeks. It helps prevent and protect dry skin, it leaves skin feeling soft, smooth and naturally healthy-looking. It is gentle enough for everyday use, fragrance free, nongreasy, and noncomedogenic.I have been using the for several years and keep it in my bathroom.Recommended. prisrob 06-05-13

  AFTER: This polish was good and half the cost of other gel polish. It did last for 2 weeks. the color in the picture was close but not exactly what the color actually looked like on. It was a lighter purple on my nails and was glittery too which you can't tell from the feature picture. It is a very pretty color.

  AFTER: I'm finding that more caster oils are becoming very useful. I've already had success with the likes ofHeritage Store Castor Oil, 32 Ounce, and the same thing can be said about this oil. For what its worth, I think this make for a good moisturizer. There doesn't seemed to have any major effects, but my skin does feel better after using this. I think its a great conditioner, so I recommend trying it.

  AFTER: I have tried both the expensive and drugstore skincare products and convinced that Olay products gives you the same results as the cosmetic counter brands. This is a great moisturizer at a great value! I have very sensitive skin and use this as a night cream. It makes my skin look better and even toned after applying! I paired this with the regenerist cleanser and get superior results.

  AFTER: The first thing I noticed about this soap was the incredible scent even before you open the package. most scented soaps have a nice smell once you take them out and sniff them with this one there is no need for that you can smell it without shoving it to you nose. The scent is not to strong though it is clean and fresh smelling. the scent stays on your skin in a light and clean way.This soap lathers nicely and is not gritty or sandy at all. this soap leaves you feeling fresh and clean and moisturized.

  AFTER: I have short eyelashes, so when I apply mascara, usually they clump up. This one is really a clump crusher. My favorite mascara before was from BareMinerals because my eyelashes looked natural but fuller with it. However, it was $20 for a small one. This one also does the same but I pay less! I totally love this one, plus the color of the barrel is green which is easy to see when it's in my purse.

  AFTER: I find that many mascaras I have used before either clump to easily, leaving a messy look or just barely coating the lash. Either way, every mascara I have tried before this would flake off throughout the day and my eyes would get much too irritated..I stumbled upon this mascara and decided to buy it on a whim because of how cheap it was. Little did I know how much I would love it. I am on my third tube of mascara and couldn't be more satisfied. It stays on my lashes without flaking off and hurting my eyes. It also achieves decent volume and comes off easily when I want it to. I just LOVE everything about this mascara. Before it, I hardly ever wore mascara but it definitely changed that.

I have LOTS of long hair and it's the best hair dryer I've had so far.  Would say I'd buy again, but I bought 3 of them for each bathroom.  Sometimes you find a product you like so well you want a backup just in case ... this is one of those products.

  AFTER: ok, there is limited clumpiness, but I still found myself pulling out my handy dandy lash separating tool, which is fine, i don't mind the extra effort but I did not find any Wow factor with this mascara. Personally I think the LashBlast Volume (orange tube) is much more clump crushing, I NEVER have clumps or any lashes sticking together even after applying layer on top of layer, and it fans it out perfectly enough where I don't even need my separating tool. This one is ok, but when this runs out im sticking with last blast volume.

  AFTER: I bought this color and a brown at the same time (same brand) both of them look great but you have to be very careful and put super thin layers on or it bubbles and wrinkles under the light. I've noticed its the thinner polishes that do that and this appears to be a thin brand

  AFTER: My review is on the whole experience of the product and SellerShippingShipping was fast, was delivered before the system could even catch up ..next day ! Great shipping. It arrived packaged perfectly.ProductThis product at first to me was a dud. I wanted to seal my polish ( Non UV Polish) which I do with my other UV coats. This product DOES NOT work with regular nail polish :(. Then I tried it on my overlay and it was tacky, much more tacky than other brands.It dries at a normal paceThe shine is a great luster shineSuggestions:Remember to use rubbing alcohol once you set the UV coat to remove the excess product build up and to remove the tackiness. Apply a really, really thin layer to get the best results.If you are looking a for a Top coat for your solar nails, natural nails and or overlays without polish this is a great product.If you are looking for a Top coat that will seal and secure ANY Polish..try Gelish or Seche brands.

  AFTER: Wow! You will love this awesome scent. To me it says fresh, fresh, fresh and it's a natural scent, not a chemically produced scent. This soap will lather up really well and rinses off clean and leaving your skin smelling fresh and smooth like a baby.This soap will leave your skin feeling soft and hydrated. And I should know because I have really dry skin and am always looking for the best product to get my skin back in shape without having to spend a fortune. I have seen several comments that say it works really good on eczema, so if you have that skin condition, give it a try and see if it helps you.

  AFTER: For years I had heard people talk about the benefits of castor oil but I was very content using my coconut oil. However, when my edges started thinning, I decided to try castor oil. I applied it to my edges almost every night before tying my hair up for the night and a month later it is thicker and longer. Be warned that this oil is thick and sticky (but I don't mind since it does the job).

  AFTER: I was really skeptical when I first bought this item, but hopeful. I have tried everything for my stretchmarks and fine lines under my eyes. I started using the roller on my thighs and on my fine lines and then I would apply my lotion and wrinkle cream when I was done. After a few times of using it....not every day, I have really seen results, especially under my eyes! People have not only noticed, but my skin is also firmer. I would definitely recommend this product in addition to your skin regimen you already have. I wont go without one now!Just an update! Ive now been using the roller for a while now and I have to say Im more than impressed with this product. The stretchmarks on my thighs are now thinner and minimal and I had though they would never get better, because Ive literally tried everything you can imagine. I dont use it every day, but it seems the morning after every use I see one after another improvement. My skin is becoming beautiful before my eyes!

  AFTER: I research a lot about before I purchased the roller , I got for 1.0 mm as my skin is still tick but have some 3 little scars from time when I was little kid that annoying me until today , well it get better , I am not sure if that are little swelling or the roller but they looks smoother , also the face skin improved after first use , it looks fresh all days long , also the pore size was dramatic smaller after couple of hours , I had red face like after sun burn for around 1 hour , I did not bleed like other due to my skin thickness but what I want was better blood circulation and it working so far , I heard also the pooping sound around the scars and dry areas from what I read it break the collagen so that was all good, I got some 3 mini blood drop on the forehead that is all after one hour everything was back to normal beside better skin showing up with radiant glow , be sure you buy the right length for your skin as each length will give you different result like 1.5  2 mm for the body  0.5 mm under eyes, 1.0mm on the face etc .. it is really great product and highly recommended if you have any problems with skin, acne, or dry, or fat , it seems to fix it in magical well understandable way , what don;t kill you make you stronger, and here is the exactly thing what it do, you hurt your skin in subtle way and skin regenerate faster and better leaving nothing else as smooth surface ..

I'm not sure why, but several times when using this item, I've ended up poking myself in the eye with it too.  I think it's the shape of the wand.  It's not awful...just not great.

  AFTER: This blow dryer was OK for the year or so I used it. It wasn't as nice as the one I was replacing, but I knew that going in and it was acceptable.However, it randomly stopped working the other day. I plugged it in to use, and it just didn't turn on (after of course resetting the cord and the outlet, and trying multiple outlets). I know this wasn't a very expensive or a professional model, but I expect more than a year of use out of a blow dryer.

  AFTER: This Just Gel polish would not cure properly and smelled strongly of solvent. Apparently someone who had the bottle before me attempted to thin it with remover or nail polish thinner. Pure gel polishes shouldn't have a strong odor and even though I understand dark colors can be trickier and take longer to cure, they should still cure after a reasonable time to the same glossy, hard finish as any other gel polish color. Mine left a thick film of uncured, pigmented polish, and the part that cured was dull and porous. I had the same problem with some clearance Gelishes from Sally Beauty. I was new to gel polishes at the time and imagine my frustration trying to get them to work!I will still buy this product again, because it's obvious the one I got was defective or tampered in some way.Purchased from Beauty Chain, who immediately approved the return, though I still need to research how to legally ship back a nail polish containing a flammable substance.Update 2014-02-22: Amazon (not BeautyChain) credited me for the purchase after I explained the dilemma, and they didn't require me to mail it back.

  AFTER: Nowadays there are all sorts of skin care products and services that offer making one's skin feel better and look younger.  I came across this product by accident.  Unlike many high tech solutions (LED light, micrtocurrent, lasers) this is mechanical device with little needles that one can roll arond the face (my device's needles are 1 mm long).I was thrilled when I received this product.  It is small and very handy to use.  Needles are very small but very sharp.  Despite their sharpness, they will not hurt your skin, device will invirogate the top layer of the skin and one will feel tinkling on the parts that roller was used on.  I typically use this roller in the evening.  After I remove makeup, exfoliate skin, clean it with cleanser and tone, I use roller for a few minutes on my chin, cheeks and forehead.  I finish up by applying eye cream, face serum and night cream for face and neck.  It is still early for me to say if there are any significant results, but for now I just like the tingling effect that tool creates.  This tool comes in a handly little plastic container.  I wish there are better instructions on the box how to keep this tool desinfected after certain number of uses.  I guess, I will just emerse it in alchohol for a while and continue to use it in a manner I am using it now.

  AFTER: Really does help stimulate collagen. They are needles and it does slightly hurt which after the first couple uses it doesn't even bother me anymore.

I prefer this over chemicals getting injected into my face any day!

  AFTER: I tried this as well as the regular castor oil, I love them both but would probably prefer this one over the other one. This one cost a couple of dollars more but it works better in my opinion. I have natural hair and my edges were thinning from a hairstyle that I had that was too tight, this grew my edges back almost completely in 45 days, I could see some growth after 2 days. I also put this on my eyebrows for fullness and have friends that rub a little on their eyelashes. I had no problems with shedding like I have read in other reviews. This is my 3 bottle that I have ordered. The only slight problem I had was a small amount of leakage when shipped.

  AFTER: This stuff works great!  When my hands get dry and chapped, they look like they would belong to a 70-year-old.  So I apply this lotion and immediately brings the look of my hands back to my actual age.  It keeps them nice and soft, all day long.  Absorbs quickly.  I also use this on my face... does not break me out, it's perfect!  It does, however, leave a bit of a "gummy" texture on your skin. But that will not affect repurchasing for me.

  AFTER: I like this product combine with an anti wrinkle cream it works well or with the anti wrinkle patch. Ok, this product you must be careful with to much pressure on the eye area will hurt.  So roll lightly.  It is like a little meat tenderizer that allows the cream, lotions, serum etc., to penetrate theskin so you will get faster results.  I liked it but stopped using it after a week, so I only gave it three stars.  But now that i am writing this review i will start using it again tonight.  Happy rolling!

  AFTER: Bought this to toss in my bag for use at work and on the go. The product rubs in easily and is not greasy on the hands. I work constantly with paper at my job and also tend to wash my hands more often than most. Both of these activities tends to dry out hands and this lotion has been a real skin saver for me. I no longer have cracked skin with bloody knuckles from the drying paper and soap from washing. Small enough that I can keep one in my desk and one in my purse or backpack.

  AFTER: 1/31/13 UPDATE: I have been using this mascara in Very Black (rather than Brown) and I have upgraded my opinion from 4 to 5 Stars. This is a very good, well priced, every day mascara that is easy to apply, dries quickly and gives one's lashes moderate volume and length.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I am quite specific in my mascara preferences and I usually don't care for curved brushes. This brush, however is excellent. Shaped like a smile or a wedge (thicker in the center and tapered at the ends), the brush is composed of many short plastic spikes that move easily through the lashes while depositing lots of pigment at the lash roots. The shape of the brush allows for quick and even application even at the more difficult to reach areas: the inner and outer corners, the lower lashes. It is because of this innovative brush that I would recommend this mascara overCoverGirl Lashblast Mascara, Very Black 800, which is a very good, everyday product.This  mascara is smooth and somewhat glossy in Brown and matte in Very Black. It applies evenly without much clumping as long as you kept the brush moving. "Build-ability", the ability to apply multiple coats one over the other was not a problem as long as the mascara had not dried fully. Once dried, the mascara would clump somewhat when a fresh coat was applied.....not terrible but not exactly what I would call a "Clump Crusher" either. My current favorite "dime store" mascara isL'Oreal Paris Voluminous Million Lashes Mascara, Blackest Blackand I can apply it in the morning before work and then at 7 pm reapply a coat for a more dramatic effect before going out to dinner. You also can do this with "Clump Crusher", but not with the same voluminous effect.This mascara comes in four shades: Very Black, Black, Black Brown, and Brown. I originally tested the Brown which I found to be extremely, surprisingly light in color, even lighter than my normal lashes. I would only recommend the Brown for extremely fair, light blondes or perhaps strawberry blondes with pale, pale lashes who are interested in a casual, natural look. Otherwise, for anyone else, I would not go lighter than the Black Brown.This mascara is an excellent choice if you are interested in natural looking lashes with moderate volume and length.

  AFTER: I've used Covergirl products for years.  I'm pleased with this mascara.  It really is a Clump Crusher!  There's nothing worse than clumps of mascara joining 2 or 3 lashes together.  The curved, plastic brush is easy to use and keeps lashes defined.  My eyes look great behind my glasses.  I recommend Covergirl Clump Crusher.It's not just for girls - I haven't been a girl for decades but still like to use natural looking eye makeup.  I think it's almost more important as I've gotten older so I don't look faded or cranky.Well done Covergirl.

It is pretty harsh when using it hurts a little- that is just the price us women have to pay to look good, so they say.

  AFTER: I know that obviously it's a bunch of needles so it's not exactly the best feeling on your skin. I feel when I do use it, I feel my skin going into repair mode if that makes sense, helping your skin tighten. I use it alongside iodine for sebaceous hyperplasia, the needles along with the iodine help to go deep into the skin to eat up the oil that causes the big bumps.

  AFTER: Both my husband and I love Aveeno products an we use only this particular bath wash because it does the best job at moisturizing the skin.  This becomes very important as you age!

  AFTER: I purchased Aveeno because it has a pretty low toxicity rating on the EWG website.  It works really well, rubs in well and does not leave my skin feeling greasy.  It's nice because it doesn't really have a smell, the fragrances are what can make a product more toxic because of the chemicals.  I recommend this to people with sensitive skin, or any other type of skin.

  AFTER: At first it does a great job of building volume without clumping. By mid-morning, though, it starts to flake, and by the end of the work day, I have horrible black smears under my eyes. I've never used a mascara that performed so poorly over time, and I've used dozens of brands and varieties over the years. Avoid.

  AFTER: This is a 4.4 ounce white bar of soap and comes in a neatly designed blue and white box.  It smells great.  But, it's a little on the perfumey side.  This is not a product for the men folk, unless he's walking on heals from a recent pedicure and has his head wrapped up in a floral towel.There are over 26 Dead Sea minerals contained in the bar.  Also present are zinc, bromide, sodium, calcium, magnesium and palm oil.  The soap can be used on a daily basis without drying out your moisture-challenged skin.We love it.  It's just what we needed!

  AFTER: The price is pretty reasonable, first of all. Ive been using it for at least 3 week, and I have to say Im not happy with the result, I expected more from it. The results arent as good as I expected, i guess therere minor improvements on my acne scars, but not drastic. I guess its gonna take a while to see actual changes. But it certainly works, I suppose.  Keep in mind, this product is NOT painless, but bearable.

  AFTER: I bought this out of curiosity without knowing what I am really purchasing .  And boy does this thing hurt when you roll it over your face!!!!  I would use it more often but it hurts too bad and it makes me sneeze continually.  It also punctured the skin on my nose to the point that it was bleeding.  I am sure it makes the product you put afterwards absorb faster because your skin is punctured.

  AFTER: This was just an okay product to me. I did find that this product clumped (despite the name) and it really didn't lengthen or thicken. I use it for during the day when I don't have much makeup on. It gives my lashes some definition. But if you're looking for a product to use with heavier makeup or for going out, this isn't it.

  AFTER: I'll start by saying I'm a Gelish fan so I was super skeptical about this polish, especially since it was half the price. I tried the Sensationail brand and never will again. But IBD is so amazing that I will likely buy mostly, if not only, IBD. It is so smooth and rich, an absolutely beautiful plum color and I also bought the Slate color with the same results. It went on smooth, evenly and didn't even require a second coat to get the full color! I highly recommend this color and this brand!

  AFTER: This glitter is a heavy glitter.  I have searched futilely for a very fine glitter in regular nail polish, and it seems that no one but me wants just a touch of glitter on my nail base color sometimes.  Then I found IBD soak-off gel Fireworks, which gives me that tasteful sparkle.  It is gorgeous with a 2 coat application over a deep red, and being a gel, it holds up for over two weeks.  What isn't to like?  If you're like me and sometimes want only a light glitter, not a heavy, thick, extremely flashy glitter, you won't be disappointed with Fireworks. Or, if you are in the mood for more bling on your nails, you can't go wrong with All That Glitters.

  AFTER: I received this product gratis, in exchange for a honest unbiased review.  I can say  with 5 stars, my skin loves this soap.  I love the texture, and how it fits perfectly in my hand. I barely drop the soap for it fits in my small hands just right, where regular bar soap feels awkward and super slippery.  This wonderful soap smells great and it is perfect for my dry skin.  I do not have to worry about showing off alligator legs when I use this soap.  I also love how the scent is fresh and clean, but not overpowering.

  AFTER: I am impressed. On a news program I heard about the new Ionic hair dryers. I already had a Revlon Ionic hair dryer, but it was several years old, and worked just fine, but the price of this one was so reasonable I thought I would give it a try. Well what they said about the new ones was correct. This really does dry your hair in half the time. It is better for your hair, as it dries your hair with less heat! Not sure how that works, but it does. Highly recommend this product!

  AFTER: This is nice mascara.  It has a nice curved wand.  No, it doesn't clump up.  Yes, it colored my lashes to a darker hue.  Other than that, I really don't see much difference between it andCoverGirl LashBlastFusion Mascara Very Black 860, 13.1 ml, 1 Tube.  Outside, of course, of the fact that this comes in a green container, and LashBlast is purple.Neither type of mascara did anything spectacular as far as I could see in terms of adding volume to my lashes.

  AFTER: I first had these with my dermatologist.. and it was a rip off! she sells it to me for $175! then i have to get these 5 collagen treatment from her clinic as well more money spent.. i undergone 3 times for these treatment,and really made a huge difference on my acne scars! the holes are no longer darker,the skin have been stimulated to create new skin to cover those holes! makes my skin tighter,but smooth.. my family just love staring at my skin,and they say,that it looks so soft,and very supple to touch.. like the rich and famous skin!but then i married an american,whose thrifty,and wont be affording my face luxury routine,so i stopped this vanity.. also my business went bad,so i cant have these kinds of treatments again..and i stumbled on these at amazon.. thought i could give it a try.. and OMG! it hurts! without the anesthesia..in the name of beauty.. i survived that.. i dont like to use anesthesia,because im not familiar with the creams being sold,and i worry that it would harm my skin.. so i use it without that.. i would tear when i roll it around my eyes.. and on the side of my forehead..i also use another roller on my legs.. i had a severe sensitivity with my legs skin.. a dermatologist told me that my skin was so thin,it gets itchy with just about anything.. i ask him what can i do to make my skin thicker,he said i cant do anything about it..that all i can do is to use all these medicines,lotions,creams,soaps that he advised me to use..still my legs gets itchy easily,and would be bruised,and scar even with the slightest scratch..my skin cracks.. one time,and that causes me to be alarmed..my dermatologist told me that if my skin itch,i should pour cold water on it,instead of hot water,which i stupidly do,and pouring alcohol so the scratch that i made which resulted with wounds would be painful.. and the itching stops! for a while,then both my legs would itch again.. it was a very horrible experience.. now i know better! wash it wild the mildest soap.like cetaphil.. with cold water! i even have cold patches when it starts to itch! id put them..anyway haahha sorry about my sorry story.. to continue...i thought.. maybe the roller can stimulate some collagen to my legs,and luckily it did! my lotions are more absorbed,and i see that my skin on my legs,becomes thicker.. not too flimsy like it used too.. now when i scratch them (slightly of course) it dont bruise easy! and now my legs skin is smoother,and looking moisturized..i do not recommend using the same roller for different parts of your body,because we use different creams for different parts of our body.. wouldnt want any unwanted reaction from mixing chemicals..so thats my review! and now that the price is much cheaper! i bought a couple of these and stock them!

  AFTER: My only complaint is that I use the concentrator attachment regularly and the attachment snaps on really loosely, so the concentrator (the attachment that you use to narrow the heat concentration) rotates and changes angle multiple times when I'm trying to blow my hair dry. It's pretty annoying, but I'm learning to deal with it. Overall, it was really cost effective and it's small so it will be good for traveling, and it's pretty powerful too.

  AFTER: I've tried lots of body washes in an effort to relieve rashes, itching, and overall dry skin related to multiple allergies. If only I had tried Aveeno when it was first recommended, I would have spared myself much misery, multiple doctor visits, and a bag of useless prescription creams. After the first use, my itching was gone; within 3 uses the rashes had disappeared. For the first time in 40 years of pricey daily lotions and oils, my skin doesn't look dry at the end of the day. This body wash is AWESOME!

  AFTER: I have been using JBCO since February 2012. I really like doing my three times a week scalp massage with this stuff. I mix it with another oil (e.g. jojoba or Vitamin E) because it is kind of thick and doesn't spread as well as I want it to on it's own.My hair grows fast, but I think that this product has given my thickness a boost. I know women who swear by it, but I encourage people to use it to see if it works for them!

  AFTER: I've used Covergirl products for years.  I'm pleased with this mascara.  It really is a Clump Crusher!  There's nothing worse than clumps of mascara joining 2 or 3 lashes together.  The curved, plastic brush is easy to use and keeps lashes defined.  My eyes look great behind my glasses.  I recommend Covergirl Clump Crusher.It's not just for girls - I haven't been a girl for decades but still like to use natural looking eye makeup.  I think it's almost more important as I've gotten older so I don't look faded or cranky.Well done Covergirl.

  AFTER: I have to say I do so love Adovia product and this one is very nice. I love they way it smells and cleans. I love to use this with my Clarisonic because it distributes more evenly than a liquid or cream soap, All I do is dampen the brush dead and than turn it on the bar so it picks up the right amount of product evenly. This face/body bar is very moisturizing and natural with dead sea minerals , its very easy to work with and nose a excellent job of cleaning. The company sent me a free sample to try so I could make an informed review but my opinions are my own . Try is and see if you dont agree

  AFTER: I've been using it for 3 days and I already see a difference around my laugh line, basically it's gone. To be fair, I had the beginning stages of laugh lines and this combined with my normal skin care work wonderfully. It is important to note that I should have purchased the 0.5mm because the 1.0mm stings. I'm still getting used to the shock of the stinging sensation. Its stops immediately  after you're done passing the area in your face. Also, make sure that your skin care doesn't add on to the inflammation of your face. I used Apple Cider Vinegar as my skin toner and I make sure not to use it the same day as I use my micro needle roller. Please be aware that sunscreen is very important. I am a person of color and I use the sensitive Oil Of Olay sunscreen moisturizer. I have not broken out at all using it for the year and a half that I've used it.Again, this product is a great complimentary with your skin care line just make sure that you don't use products that is alcohol based or inflammatory skin care product the same day. You'll need a soothing product. If you use natural products I'd suggest a little grapeseed oil afterward on your skin.Oh most importantly, wash your face first and I forgot to mention DO NOT ADD PRESSURE as you roll the micro needle roller on your face. Just roll it on your face, for me I roll it twice around in one direction. You may try it differently but do not add pressure the needles are already doing their job.Hope this helps someone with sensitive skin.

I work on my feet and get pedicures about once every couple months and the ladies comment that my feet are really good, not too beat up.  My hands, however....

My face was so shiny at work the first day, I almost didn't recognize myself.  I don't have oily skin.  Might work for people that don't have sensitive skin.  Apparently that's not me.  Very happy to pay half the price with Amazon than the store!  I just can't use it.  Went back to Garnier Skin Care Renew with spf 28.  Cheaper product. Has spf.  Never breaks me out.

  AFTER: Okay ... At first I was thinking, &#34;Yay! Free soap.&#34; I have a slight addiction to soaps and things that smell good.THEN IT ARRIVED IN THE MAIL.I honestly do not think after trying this that I will buy anything else.First the smell, because I always start with the smell. It smells AMAZING. There isn't one bad thing to say about the smell. I think I huffed the box a good five or six times getting myself excited for bath time.Second. You know how most soaps after you rinse them off, your skin feel rough? Your fingers don't slide over smooth, its a bumpy ride. This stuff. NOT THE CASE! I swear I feel like a baby. Well my skin does. It is really soft. So the moisturizing capabilities of this stuff is awesome. I normally use dove, because its soft too. But this stuff blows my normal brand right out of the water.Third. Seems to have a slight healing capability too. I had broken out really bad after trying a lotion with too much perfume. my skin reacted so badly to it, that I had little red bumps &#34;Which naturally I had picked at and irritated farther.&#34; ONE USE and they were almost gone. Two days ... they were finished. So I am thinking that if I had a really bad break out on my face &#34;Which I don't know if its true because thanks to vitamin c serums I haven't have that issue.&#34; But my assumption is that it would work on clearing that up quite well too. IF YOU GUYS TRY IT, and you do have a problem with acne. Please let me know. &#34;I am curious.&#34;All in all this stuff ROCKS! I don't like the price tag off 11 dollars a bar ... but I love what it does for my skin, so I will be looking past that. I truthfully LOVE this soap.Thanks for stopping by xxDee

  AFTER: I am 37 and starting to get those fine laugh lines and "crows feet".  I decided to give this a whirl.  While I like the unscented version better, the scented is still nice and not offensive; I have gotten creams in the past which are just too offensive and give me a headache.  My husband had commented on the earlier creams and for this one he hasn't said a word! (Not to mention the earlier ones did not work though I cannot remember, for the life of me, what they were; obviously I was not impressed.)The scented version has a light, non-offensive odor.  The unscented version has no odor (imagine that).  Regardless, they both do reduce fine lines!I was using it for about a week (8 days maybe?) before I saw a difference.  My fine lines were finer and less noticable.  (Probably no one but I noticed them before I started using this but it made me feel better and that is the point, isn't it?)And, when I got them, the exfoliating face-wash was being sold with it for half off.  And that is also a great product.I recommend this for anyone with light crease lines and who wants to keep their skin rejuvenated! I also highly recommend that you use the Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub Face Wash, as aforementioned.  I will also review that!

My favorite mascara before was from BareMinerals because my eyelashes looked natural but fuller with it. However, it was $20 for a small one. This one also does the same but I pay less! I totally love this one, plus the color of the barrel is green which is easy to see when it's in my purse.

Harsh chemicals in other soaps tend to make my skin feel really dry and itchy and then i end up piling on lotions which also contain certain chemicals as well.Did you know that some lotions actually contain alcohol? not to mention dyes and other harmful chemicals. Crazy huh? But getting back to this soap...here are just a few things that i find awesome about this wonderful product:It is Infused with 100% Pure Dead Sea Salts from the Dead SeaDead Sea Salt Contains over 21 Minerals Key to Skin Health and BeautyDeeply Moisturizing and Hydrating Soap great for Dry and Normal to Dry SkinDead Sea Minerals Essential to Skin Function Contained in the Soap Include Magnesium, Potassium, Sodium, Zinc and More.Great Value and Benefits for A Daily Moisturizing Facial Cleanser!!!After using this the first time my face feels really clean and fresh...almost don't want to apply my makeup LOL...just feels really good, soft and radiant.If you are looking for a high quality soap that the whole family can use...or just to treat yourself to some well deserved pampering...i suggest getting some :) Your face and body will feel so much nicer and you will not want to go back to using those harshful chemical filled soaps ever again.

I looked horrible!  My entire face was flaky; forehead, chin, eyebrow areas.  I looked like a monster.  I read on WebMd that the active ingredient in this lotion is actually what helps heal dry skin so I gave it a shot.  That was almost 3 years ago.  I use this all over my body, but even more so I use it on my face because that is the only place I have a problem with dry skin, especially in the winter.  Target sells this size bottle for $10.99+ (and on numerous occasions it has been out of stock)but with Amazon's super saver subscription I get it delivered on time every 2 months for a cheaper price.

It is an amazing at what it's uses are all for, a lot of cure alls in one product, bonus there. For the hair it is thick so you do not need alot. Ilike to use after a hot bath as it soaks into your damp skin and you can really reap the rewards, especially before bed when your body recharges and heals. Strong believer in oils, and great to chase away dry skin!

  AFTER: A soft soap with a clean scent, this Dead Sea Salt Soap was soothing to my skin. This soap was more like a lotion bar, cleansing thoroughly and leaving my skin moisturized. I like that it has palm/palm kernel oil and magnesium along with the dead sea salts. I absolutely fell in love with it and am recommending my husband try it!Shipping and packaging: this product was shipped in a timely manner with no damage received during transit.

  AFTER: Dead Sea Salt has all sorts of minerals, but I was skeptical whether it would really make any difference in a soap. I have only used the soap a couple times so I can't comment on long term skin effects, but I can say the following things:1. The soap is super moisturizing. My skin was so soft after showering.2. It smells really nice (and neutral - my husband can use it without complaining...)3. The bar is solid. Other moisturizing bars disintegrate. This bar is holding up well in the shower.A few of the minerals in the soap are magnesium and potassium - both necessary for healthy skin and muscles. We soak in epsom salts (magnesium) for health so if the body can absorb any of these from the soap, it's probably a good thing.

  AFTER: I've been obsessed with my DIY gel nail kit that I got for my birthday and have already accumulated five colors (two Sephora by OPI, one Sally Hansen, and two IBD). To be honest, I prefer the formulation of IBD the best. I find that I have to do three coats (as opposed to two coats with the OPI and Sally Hansen). In terms of removal, I'd say they're all pretty much the same...As for the color itself (Sparkling Embers), I'd say it's a pale rosy gold - almost like champagne! Although there's definitely glitter, the color is subtle enough for me to wear to work (and I work in a pretty conservative commercial real estate office). The thin formulation allows you to pick exactly how much color you want on your nails (rather than just glombing it on all at once).When I first purchased this product, the shipping calculation said seven business days, but it was actually delivered exactly a week after I ordered it. As a long time Prime member, I'm used to the (almost) instant gratification of two-day shipping, but this was definitely worth the wait!

At first I thought I could replace Finacea (Rosacea Rx cream), but that's when I got into trouble...when I didn't use Finacea first.If used AFTER Finacea which really dries out the skin, especially around eyes and mouth...when used after (on top of settled Finacea), it makes my skin feel less tight and apparently has eased some fine lines...unreal!Retinol is murder on Rosacea-skin and most "wonder" products have retinol. This does not have retinol...TG!

  AFTER: I stumbled across this item in a search for something else.  I decided to read up on it. Then I decided to try it.  I don't know if I can get past the pain of it.  I am not sure how hard I should be pressing, however, it is painful and the instructions say to go in a pattern that goes basically in every direction,  There is also discomfort afterwords a slight burning and then the next day itching. Not sure if I will get any results.  I just did a chemical peel a few weeks ago and now will use this again will update as I time goes on.

  AFTER: I usually use all Gelish products but I loved this color and thought I would give it a try with my Gelish foundation and top it off...  so this morning I put this on my toes and OMG!!  The color is just amazing... the fine glittery shimmer that's in the color makes it have so much depth to it just being a very vibrant blue color..  can't wait to do a mani with this color this summer...  such a beautiful ocean water blue color...  LOVE IT!!!  and the product itself for a cheaper gel polish is really nice...  applies just as good as gelish..

  AFTER: This is a good cream if you have sensitive or combination skin....or dry skin. if it is oily all over...it will be too heavy for you. not for teens or early twenties... its good for more mature skin and you will love how your skin will stay moist for a long period of time.....I use it all over my face even around my eyes and I normally can not do this with just any face product cause it will sting and burn my eyes.....not this one! I am  impressed!!! so if your looking for something that will help firm and minimize wrinkles and not harsh on the skin and easy to find ...this is it!!I gave it a 4 rating because I do not care for the heavy container and the lid...but product inside is really good!

  AFTER: Unpacked item, which I felt was well packaged, and sanitary.  It did not have elaborate instructions; basically a small paragraph on the side of the box, but that was fine.  The item did not appear cheap to me like others stated.  I mean&#8230;what do you expect for $10 anyhow?  It did seem smaller than expected, but no big deal.  I washed my face and rolled as directed, 10 rolls in each spot.  I bought this because of previous use with an acupuncture mat (aka Bed of Nails), gently puncturing yourself definitely increases blood flow and endorphin production.  So I can sort of see how this would stimulate collagen growth.  My face turned red, and felt like mild sunburn.  I did my hands and neck too.  I didn&#8217;t really notice anything but irritation at first.  Did my regular routine and went to bed.  This morning, there is no doubt it did something.  The lines around my mouth (I smoked for 17 yrs) are way less apparent, same with the lines on my forehead.  My left hand has tiny red dots, like broken blood vessels?  I may have pushed too hard, but I didn&#8217;t think I was when I was doing it.  My skin feels tight, but like that feeling you get from sunburn.  I don&#8217;t wear heavy makeup, or concealers.  I use a lot of moisturizers, especially Organic Coconut Oil on my fac, hair and body at night (anyone that never has tried coconut oil needs to go get some now!! I used Spectrum Organic Coconut Oil, you can get it at a local grocery store-more info check out my blogs [...] ) during the day I used a tinted SPF moisturizer, it&#8217;s very light.  My skin definitely has a glow today!  May just be irritation but whatever it is, it looks better, so I&#8217;m happy with that!  I think this thing works and honestly didn&#8217;t expect to notice such a difference after first use; I will use it again for sure!  I can see how people with sensitive skin would not like it.  I have a high pain tolerance, I also epilate and wax, so this isn&#8217;t that bad to me.  I&#8217;m hoping it reduces the size of the pores on my cheeks.  And I&#8217;m going to keep using it on my hands.  I&#8217;m glad I found this thing!  I will probably use at most, 1x a week because of how tight my skin feels.  Glad I didnt' go with 2mm yet.

  AFTER: This polish was good and half the cost of other gel polish. It did last for 2 weeks. the color in the picture was close but not exactly what the color actually looked like on. It was a lighter purple on my nails and was glittery too which you can't tell from the feature picture. It is a very pretty color.

  AFTER: I needed a hair dryer to use about once or twice a month. I found this at a great price with mostly good reviews so I decided to purchase it. I am transitioning to natural kinky/curly hair and have BSL hair overall. I almost always air dry so i needed something to dry it if I was ever in a hurry. What I was looking for was: at least 1875 Watt dryer, Ionic, Compact, With multiple attachments (at least comb, diffuser and concentrator), Not too loud. This dryer fills all those requirements... except for one thing: no comb-attachment.Since this came with two attachments, I planned to purchase the third one from Revlon. For those unaware, Revlon hair products are licensed to Helen of Troy. I contacted HoT to inquire about which model of comb would fit this dryer, since most comb attachments are expensive and I did not want to waste my money. They were very fast to respond but no one could tell me if there was one available that would fit. After a week, I received an email saying that they do not make a comb attachment that would fit this particular model. They said that this particular dryer has a specific nozzle so no other attachments from them, or other brands would fit it. I was disappointed, since nowhere in the package or description page does it say this. Perhaps I was naive to think that a company would never think not to make other attachments that would fit their best selling economy model, other than the standard out of the box ones. Now I have to think if this dryer was worth it at all. Who wants to buy a separate dryer just for that one extra task?About the product:Pros:lightweight, unbulky overall.Heats up considerably. Warm is an adequate setting for me, but it might be too hot for someone with very fine straight hair.2 attachments, including the concentrator.good value for the price.fast shipping.Medium noiseCons:Cord is too short. Does not rotate easily either.Very cheap plastic, i'm afraid this could melt with heavy prolonged use.Can only be used with the specific attachments that come with it (2), which are not for sale separately (If you contact Helen of Troy they might send you some for free if yours break)Diffuser is a joke. Not long enough for long hair to dry effectively. The fingers are too short and it's not concave so the hot air just stays in the surface. People's heads are nor flat, Revlon!Conclusion:If you use your hair dryer very often, for long periods of time uninterrupted, this might die on you. If you use it very irregularly it's a good balance between the price and use. If you want to use other attachments other than the ones that come with it, you might be out of luck. If you are purchasing this solely for the diffuser, I would stay away from this. Would I purchase this again if it broke down? No, I wouldn't, but it will do for the time being.

  AFTER: I am impressed. On a news program I heard about the new Ionic hair dryers. I already had a Revlon Ionic hair dryer, but it was several years old, and worked just fine, but the price of this one was so reasonable I thought I would give it a try. Well what they said about the new ones was correct. This really does dry your hair in half the time. It is better for your hair, as it dries your hair with less heat! Not sure how that works, but it does. Highly recommend this product!

  AFTER: I enjoyed using this soap because it did leave my skin feeling very moisturized without feeling like it left a residue behind. I don't have to use tons of lotion afterwards because of how moisturizing it is, which is great (for my pocket as well as my skin). Personally, the smell wasn't too strong for my nose when I opened the box, but I did let it sit out for a couple of days before I actually used it so that might have calmed the scent down some. Overall I did enjoy using this soap.

  AFTER: I have only used this twice, but wow!!! I had a tummy tuck 6 years ago. I still like to wear a bikini, but I have a long brown bumpy scar. (I was allergic to the stiches they used and my scar bubbled up and didn't heal nice and smooth.)I had been trying hydroquine 4% cream the derm. gave my for my pregnancy mask off and on on it, but it didn't really do anything. I read about the 1mm derma roller and thought I'd give it a try. I don't have a lot of feeling on my scar, so I was able to real "go at it" without any nubbing cream. I wasn't overly harsh, but I can see where I pierced the skin. Once everything was rolled, I looked really sunburnt and had a few flecks of blood. THEN I rubbed the hydroquine cream on top. The next day neither my hubby or I could believe it! It was a tad lighter BUT SMOOTH, NOT BUMPY! I was thinking, maybe everything was just puffy so I waited. A week later, my scar is still smooth!I just did the derma roller again this morning on my scar. More to try to get the cream in it to lighten it some more. There's not too much more to smooth out, so that doesn't bother me. I just can't stop rubbing my fingers over the scar!!!I did do my face the first time when I did my scar w/o any nubbing cream. It is do-able. I did find myself beathing very deeply and concentrating, almost as I did with my contractions when in labor. My face felt sunburnt for the night and tight the next morning. I am going to do it again, but my new serum is on the way, so I am waiting for that and I read you shouldn't do it too often because you don't want to destroy the collagen you are trying to build up. So far, I have nothing but good things to say about the derma roller!

  AFTER: Fell for the price and description of extreme lash lengthening, however in real life the mascara was on the dry side and it did not do much at all for my lashes.Perhaps I just got some old stock (who knows since they don't date these products - which they absolutely should do!) but name of this mascara is totally misleading, but for someone who wants a minimal and natural looking eyelash, this would be a good choice.

  AFTER: This truly does crush clumps. The wand is curved, with a thinner inner side, to lay down product, and a fatter outer edge that can comb and separate lashes, not that they needed it. I got the results that would normally require a lash comb.Unlike the other fat wand CG mascaras, I also didn't poke myself in the eye trying to reach the base of my lashes. No flaking all day and my lashes are as soft as if I were not wearing mascara. A great product, and I find other mascaras to be a compromise. Good stuff,!

  AFTER: Works wonderfully! I have dry skin and love this lotion. Really love that it doesn't contain all the toxins that most other lotions have. Our skin absorbs these toxins and don't we have enough in the air and our food and water. Cutting out toxins we have control over and Aveeno has the right idea.

  AFTER: I've made a few skin care changes recently, using this being one of them. I really think its making a difference! Basically I wash my face as usual, disinfect this with some rubbing alcohol, let it dry, and run it over my face and neck. I haven't wanted to press too hard, it does feel uncomfortable as you would expect, but it still pierces the skin. I follow it with the Cosmetic Skin Solutions 20% Vitamin C etc from here, stings for a second but quickly goes away. Next morning, my skin looks great. I've been doing it about twice a week, which seems to be a good frequency. I have noticed the occasional pimple after, not sure it's a causal relationship but probably my disinfecting routine could use some work. This thing is so cheap if you're thinking about it, I'd just try it. Just be sure to have a good disinfectant for before each use and serum for after.

  AFTER: Thus far I like the product and the results. Would repurchase and recommend.  Next time I will probaby order one that has a scent like coconut or lavender.  The product is thick as other reviews have indicated but I like that b/c it does help &#34;lay them edges&#34; or sealing ends when rocking a twist and/or braid out.  I have also mixed with other oils like coconut and/or jojoba when using as co-wash, deep conditioning, or with leave-in conditioners.

  AFTER: Most people forget about their hands when using sunscreen, but your hands can be more of a giveaway to your age than your face. This lotion provides long lasting moisturization, as well as good sun protection for every day exposure. One pump on my hands soaks in quickly, what little scent there is dissipates after a few minutes, and my skin is moisturized without feeling greasy.

  AFTER: This lotion totally absorbs into the skin - NO greasy feel...absolutely none - zero!  Super light weight.  It is not only unscented - but doesn't have any fragrance at all which is fantastic - it doesnt even smell like lotion so you can then wear perfume without any clash of scents.  Leaves my skin smooth and super soft.  On a 1-10 scale...this lotion gets an 11.

  AFTER: I have 22 inch long straight & silky hair. I love to oil my hair before every wash. Generally I use coconut oil or almond oil & leave it at least over night. I wash hair every 3 days. Few days back I see this castor oil here I decided to give it a try. And I am happy that consider it. All I can say is now my hair are more beautiful. All I do is mix 5-6 drops of castor oil with my regular hair oil & then heat it a little & apply thoroughly. It is very thick so a few drops will go a long way so be careful while using it for the first time. If u will use more quantity then it vl be harder to remover oil in one wash. After 2-3 uses one will get idea how much is required for him/her. For the ppl with very dry hair this works best. I am using it only for hair so I have no idea about how it works for other uses. I think mine will last for quite long as I need few drops in every use.Definitely recommend it.

  AFTER: I am a lover of Adovia products, so naturally this Dead Sea Salt Soap is no exception!The soap size is perfect for use on the face, or even in the shower. I like to use mine with a loofah and create a nice lather that way. I have sensitive skin, and I had no issues at all with this. I find that most Adovia products are mild enough and do not cause any irritation. As I mentioned above I use this in the shower on my body, but also as a facial soap as well. It leaves my skin feeling very soft, clean, hydrated and smooth. I like the fact that I can use this soap all over, makes for a better value.The smell is a fragrant clean sort of scent. I find that after I have used the soap, I will have a slight scent left lingering on my skin, which is nice. I can use my perfumes over it, and not have my perfume scent be mixed with my soap scent.I have had absolutely no issues with this soap at all, and it is something I give my recommendation on trying!Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.

I am loving Dead Sea Salt products and will keep trying more options that come available.

  AFTER: To start, I am a huge fan of bar soaps. I love how little packaging they have in comparison to liquid soaps, and I also love that what packaging they do have is usually a box which is biodegradable. I'm all about reducing my waste so I don't have to worry about reusing or recycling much, and bar soaps help with that goal.So I'm going in expecting to be pleased, and I was overwhelmed! This is hands-down the most moisturizing bar soap I have ever tried, and I've used absolutely wonderful, hand-made, cold-processed goat's milk soaps. Don't expect this soap to rinse squeaky clean - it leaves a slight film of something softening on your skin that soaks right in as soon as it's dried. You don't feel anything but smooth, supple skin after you wash with this. I can definitely skip moisturizer on my face when I use it to wash away the day, and I don't find my hands drying out nearly as much as they do with normal bar soaps - or even other good ones.It's also a hefty, solid bar that's incredibly long-lasting. Most of the really moisturizing bar soaps I've tried have melted away quite easily, especially if left in damp places (like the shower). This one just keeps going and going...I've used it multiple times a day for nearly two weeks straight now, and you'd hardly be able to tell by looking at it - the logo has barely worn smooth.About the only thing that approaches a negative for me is the scent. It's very reminiscent of &#34;old lady perfume&#34; smells to me - that really heavy, heady floral-type fragrance. It's incredibly strong in this soap, so much so that it constantly fills the room with the scent, even when you aren't using it. Fortunately, though, it doesn't linger much on the skin, so I don't wind up smelling it all day long. Thanks to that, I really don't have much of a complaint about the smell.Honestly, it's hard to say anything bad about this product - I absolutely love it, the price is reasonable, and I'm definitely prepared to order more!

  AFTER: Before purchasing JBCO I researched it for about a year.  WHY OH WHY did it take me so long to purchase?!!!!  This is a must have staple within your head to toe daily beauty regime!  It has a faint peanutty type of smell, but it's nothing that I can't deal with.  When I'm using this on my scalp and hair, whether it's before bed or styling for the day, once I use it, I spray my hair with Palmer's Olive Oil with Vitamin E hair spray because it has a nice clean smell that gives my hair that high gloss sheen all day long.  You will see results with this product so be patient.  Everyone's hair grows at a different pace.  It also depends on how much and how often you apply this product.  I also use it on my eyelashes and around my eyes for my night moisturizer, as well as for blemishes, dry cracked skin, cuts, burns, it is an all purpose beauty secret.  A little goes a long way.  BUY IT, USE IT AND SPREAD THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT IT ~ ENJOY!!!

I know many people like this soap and even saw some videos where they used it directly on the face!! I can finally tell you that this soap works just like the regular body soap.It does clean very well,although it dries my skin like hell! I dare to use it on my face though! It smell nice like regular soap and this soap last for a long time i guess because it still in my bathroom! &#9786; One more thing I would like to mention that I use to wash my clothes with this soap, lol! and it does clean well and smell good as well.Overall, I think this soap works just like regular soap and kinda dry me out.So I would probably not going to repurchase it again!

  AFTER: I get really dry skin, especially in the wintertime.  I'm sure you're excited and curious which parts of my body experience the dryness, right?  Well let me ease your delights!  Under my ears is the main spot.  In fact that's the main reason I bought skin cream to begin with.  Flakey, crusty skin that peels on my lobes, on both ears.  Skin also peels on the back of my ears.  It's sort of annoying.  Another popular spot is on the sides and back of my neck.  I will wake up and see balls of dry skin on my bed linen that will absolutely *have* to be shaken off.  This Aveeno lotion helps quite a bit.  Applying enough lotion around bedtime will ensure that by morning my skin will be healthy and improved. My lips also get crusty but I have chapstick to take care of that one.  My forehead and the tip of my nose are two other frequent skin-peeling locations.  Aveeno skin lotion will fix whatever's ailing your skin, guaranteed.

  AFTER: I apply a few drops of the serum to my "trouble spots (around eyes, mouth - laugh lines, and forehead-in between brows)" every other day and I feel it makes a big difference in smoothing out fine lines. It seems like it helps with collagen boosting too. I feel like I'm just barely starting to discover signs of aging at 31 years old, and it may be my entire skin care routine that's helping. This stuff does sting a bit (especially if I use it after derma-rolling - OUCH!), and it smells like burnt nuts, but it is working for me. I've been using it for 2 1/2 months and I keep the little bottles in the fridge. I'll definitely re-order this when I'm out!

  AFTER: I was recently asked to try Adovia's Dead Sea Salt Soap in exchange for my unbiased opinion.  I personally don't care for bar soap because they leave that waxy feel on your skin, but I love all of the other Dead Sea products from Adovia so I wanted to give it a try.As soon as I opened the box, it had a fresh light scent that was very pleasing.The later is very rich and washes off completely.There was no residue at all!!!My Skin was so soft and it smelled fresh all day.I also noticed that the bar of soap doesn't get that slimy feel when it gets wet like other bar soaps do.Overall I loved everything about the soap, I noticed some say the price was a bit high, but this bar will outlast a bottle of body wash for sure.  I think it is very comparable in price, considering the quality is amazing.My son has eczema, and I had him try the soap and it was so gentle on his skin.  This is great for all skin types.

  AFTER: I have been meaning to try this Olay product ever sinceGood Housekeeping (1-year auto-renewal)tested it, and said it was better than a $500 cream they also tested.  Well, either they changed the ingredients in this product, or I don't have the same skin type the testers had, because this cream did nothing but make my skin look duller.  It was too thick.  Now, on toOlay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream, 1.7 Ouncefor two months . . . .

  AFTER: I am very pleased to use this oil. I heard great reviews about castor oil when it comes to natural hair. So I wanted to give it a go, being a "natural products only" type of gal. After deep conditioning and washing with black soap, I went with my usual routine and applied my Kinky Curly leave-in, and instead of purely jojoba, I used jojoba combined with castor oil on soaking wet, freshly washed hair with the leave-in. The result: no sealing in the moisture when my hair is 90% dry! The castor oil is heavy enough to lay down the cuticle layer on the hair shaft down, acting as a sealant. Just like sealing with a butter, except lighter! Lighter means your hair moves more easily. I don't actually need shea butter to seal in my hair now, because this is able to replace it. However I love my shea butter, and I won't give it up without a fight! ;)I now oil my ends with castor oil daily, and my hair seems stronger. I thought I had virtually no breakage then, but NOW its amazing. No breakage at all, hair is shiny, stays moisturized longer, and it helps my skin too. Highly recommend for dry, unruly hair, or dry skin. Tip: More is less with this stuff! You only need 1-2 drops, so it will last a long time.EDIT:1 year later, I am just now purchasing my second  bottle of castor oil. It really lasts. I apply castor oil (2-3 drops per section) to my hair after misting with water mixed with kinky-curly knot today and various oils.(Or after a co-wash)  Prevents breakage, retains the moisture, acts as an emollient for skin and hair, giving hair that luster and skin a fresh glow. I dont use too much because it leaves a greasy feeling. So, dont over-do it. Add essential oils to mask its natural scent, as its a bit funny on its own. I love ylang ylang. Almost forgot to mention, castor oil is wonderful for protecting the skin and hair in winter. My skin and hair have improved after continuous use of castor oil. Will never NOT BE in my cabinet!

  AFTER: When I opened this the first thing I noticed was the pleasant aroma that drifted up.  It was quite enticing and I couldn't wait to try it.  Oh my! It was beyond wonderful! Who needs to take a trip to the spa when you can exfoliate and leave your skin feeling smooth and clean and refreshed at home! This soap didn't feel like any soap i've ever used before.  Having always had dry skin this was something perfect to keep mine feeling better.  I cannot wait to try more Adovia products in the future! This is something I recommend for sure!

  AFTER: Review by Tom's wife.Love the smell & texture of this cream. However, I do not feel that it's hydrating enough for my dry skin. Maybe I should use it with the Regenerist serum. Strangely, I find the Olay Total Effects creams more hydrating.*Update: From 3 stars to 4 stars. I've been using this for approx. 2 weeks every evening now. Originally, I didn't think this cream was that great. I decided to leave my skin slightly damp before applying. I find this makes the product go on more smoothly. So, now my skin feels more hydrated. :)

  AFTER: I got this because I had to switch up a lot of my normal products when I became pregnant. I had heard this was safe for pregnancy and wrote Olay who assured me that all of their products are safe for pregnant women to use. The texture is nice and it does help moisturize and doesn't seem to break me out. Normally I prefer a retinol cream by Neutrogena but I can't use retinol products while pregnant. This has been a nice substitution. I will probably switch back once I am able but for now it was nice to find something that is safe to use, helps with my dry skin and is effective.

  AFTER: After reading reviews of this product, I was a little leary about getting this. But I went with the purchase and was excited when it arrived in the mail. I tried it that very night I got home and I love it. Granted no, I can't see any results, but there is something about the roller that is a stress reliever. I've used it twice now along with the St. Ives Timeless Skin Collagen Facial Moisturizer and my skin glows!! I am 32 years old and wanted to do some &#34;preventative maintenance&#34; on my skin and I think it shows. Others mentioned to disinfect the product BEFORE and AFTER each use. These are little needles that are puncturing your skin. Infections will happen if you're not smart about disinfecting your face and the roller.

  AFTER: This mascara was actually my first foray into the world of NYX... Aka, my current obsession! I came across Doll Eye while trying to find a mascara that was not tested on animals, as the thought of animal cruelty makes me ill.The stuff works well. I'd compare it to Boots No. 7 Volumizing mascara. Unfortunately, there's no &#34;wow&#34; factor. My friends all use Benefit and L'oreal, and Maybelline and get much more definitive results. I guess I've just got to keep searching for my holy grail of mascaras.Thanks for reading!

  AFTER: This is a powerful dryer, but it doesn't singe my hair the way most do.  I'm used to a smaller dryer, so the heft took a little getting used to, but my small ones never felt like a salon dryer the way this one does.  My one caveat is if you have a specific storage space, be sure to pay attention to the measurements.  I didn't, but I lucked out.  It stays in a drawer in my vanity that has an electrical outlet built in, and it fits in there with no room to spare.  If it's even lying on a hairpin or its own cord, the drawer won't shut. So, I'm glad I bought it, and I expect we'll have a long and beautiful relationship.

  AFTER: I bought this to use with the oil cleansing method. I am still experimenting with my oil ratios. But I am already in love, my skin is becoming more clear than it has been since I was 10. Castor oils is the actual cleanse soap, in the oil cleansing method, it can be drying so you have to find out just how much you need for your own personal cleansing routine. I enjoy Now brand, I just wish they carried an organic version. I may buy another castor oil when I am out that is organic.

  AFTER: I really like this mascara by Covergirl. It is a good, low-price mascara for daytime wear. However, this mascara is NOT going to be a plumper...it is a good basic mascara for length. I haven't had any issues with clumping or with smudging with this mascara.

  AFTER: I was really skeptical when I first bought this item, but hopeful. I have tried everything for my stretchmarks and fine lines under my eyes. I started using the roller on my thighs and on my fine lines and then I would apply my lotion and wrinkle cream when I was done. After a few times of using it....not every day, I have really seen results, especially under my eyes! People have not only noticed, but my skin is also firmer. I would definitely recommend this product in addition to your skin regimen you already have. I wont go without one now!Just an update! Ive now been using the roller for a while now and I have to say Im more than impressed with this product. The stretchmarks on my thighs are now thinner and minimal and I had though they would never get better, because Ive literally tried everything you can imagine. I dont use it every day, but it seems the morning after every use I see one after another improvement. My skin is becoming beautiful before my eyes!

  AFTER: Is your hair thinning? Edges breaking off? Want thicker hair? This is the oil for you. One of my fellow natural hair bloggers recommended this product to me and I have not been disappointed. I do not have a problem with thin hair or breakage but I would to ensure that doesn't occur. I started using this product daily to apply to my hairline prior to smoothing it back. Since I've been using it, I've noticed that my hair all over is really thick and really strong. It has a nutty smell to it and a thick consistency. It smooths onto your hair very easily and is absorbed well.

  AFTER: There is a deep wrinkle between my eyebrows I've used this on and on my neck and I do notice an improvement in the wrinkles when I use this regularly which is about 2-4 times a week. It doesn't hurt just a little prickly feeling, just go slow and roll back and forth 3-4 times then lift and move to the next spot.  However when I use this between my eyebrows at the top of my nose it does make me sneeze, but that could just be me.

  AFTER: This was just an okay product to me. I did find that this product clumped (despite the name) and it really didn't lengthen or thicken. I use it for during the day when I don't have much makeup on. It gives my lashes some definition. But if you're looking for a product to use with heavier makeup or for going out, this isn't it.

  AFTER: This is a great mascara, and gives a very natural look. The mascara goes on thin and the brush definitely does not produce clumps. It does not give a bold or thick look (not much volume), but it gives a nice, moderate curl and looks very natural. Great for everyday wear, but maybe use something more exciting for a night-out look.

  AFTER: I love this product, it feels so natural and the scent is great, although a little stronger than I prefer for my facial skin (I am sensitive to fragrances).Oh how I loved testing out the Dead Sea Salt Soapfollow for this review. If you&#8217;ve been following me for a while, you know that I have loved Dead Sea Salt products that I have used in the past, well this product is no different!The bar of soap arrived to my house from my Amazon order and I opened up the box to see a lovely blue colored bar of soap. The fragrance of the soap is quite refreshing, though a little more fragrance than I usually enjoy in my soap. The texture of the bar of soap is unusual, in that it feels a little bit textured to the touch especially while washing with it, the bar is not shiny like most commercial bar soaps, the look and texture is like a good bar of homemade soap.Dead Sea Salt does contain a lot of minerals and the Dead Sea has been though to have many health and beauty benefits for ages, even Cleopatra loved the benefits of the Dead Sea thousands of years ago. Today we are lucky as products come out with Dead Sea Salts in them so we can experience some of the benefits without traveling to the Dead Sea ourselves. The problem is some of the products that claim to be Dead Sea Salt products don&#8217;t contain enough of the Dead Sea Salt to make a difference at all in your skin.  With this Soap, I find that their claims are not only believable but that is has helped to settle down some of my skin problems, yes my recent flare has my rash back on some of my body and my face right now, however the Dead Sea Salt has seemed to settle down the Lupus skin flare up.I did use the Dead Sea Salt Soap on my face once in the shower and I have to say that it did leave my face squeaky clean to the touch and with a very light moisturized feeling. However my preferred, since my face is so very highly sensitive to fragrance, is to use it on my body. I really loved sudsing up my washcloth with this bar of soap, the resulting suds were small, soft and had a very gentle fragrance. After rinsing, just like on my face, the result was squeaky clean yet lightly moisturized.Now usually after using anything with Dead Sea Salts in it, I recommend rinsing well and then applying moisturizer&#8230; with this soap I recomend rinsing well and the moisturizer is your choice. The Dead Sea Salt Soap is made for Normal to Dry Skin  (and of course skin in between). For me? I rinsed well and the I still did moisturize, most of the time. When I didn&#8217;t moisturize my terribly dry skin on my legs showed dry flaking, so just when too worn out to bother moisturizing, I just hid those legs. lolThank you to Adovia Skin Care for allowing me to review their Dead Sea Salt Soap, I am so in love! Thank you again!

  AFTER: I have lots of IBD colors.  And, I love them.  This one, not so much.  It went on really thin.  It took 4 coats to get the true yellow color and by then it was neon in shade.

  AFTER: Works well! It's creamy and thick, and is fragrance free, but kind of has an oat-ish smell, not surprising since it has "natural colloidal oatmeal" in it. Actually, reminds me a little of breakfast oatmeal in color and consistency. My skin was really dry and itchy, my doctor recommended Aveeno. When I used it, the next day, my skin felt much better. I like it because it doesn't contain fragrances or other non essential chemicals. I highly recommend it.

  AFTER: I liked this mascara a lot. It lets me build length without a bunch of clumps. The only bad thing is that it is tough to get off.

I also mix it in with 100percent Shea butter for all over skin protection and 'glow'.  If you have a skin issue, it seems to help turn dead skin cells over and helps to heal.IT IS NOT STICKY, blends well and gives hair a great sheen, also.I really love this all-natural, food-grade product. Remember, what you put on your skin, goes into your skin. Please try using all natural products for the health of your body and skin !!!!

  AFTER: This bar soap is very moisturizing and lathers up really nicely. It's perfect for anyone with dry or normal/dry skin, since it hydrates so well. The bar itself is a nice thick size - bigger than most other bar soaps I have used - so it will last quite awhile. I'm usually not a fan of bar soaps since they tend to leave my skin dry, but this soap is as moisturizing and sudsy as a body wash cream. And the best part is that it contains natural ingredients from the earth.At first I was just using the soap on my body in the shower, until I realized I should be using it on my face too, as the directions state. I always get kind of nervous when trying new cleansers on my face and I've never tried a facial bar soap before, but man, this one really impressed me! I have sensitive skin and didn't have any irritation or redness, like I usually do after washing my face. I could feel all the dry skin being washed away, and it looks like it helped clear out my pores as well. This soap rinsed away easily and left my face feeling super clean and soft. I'm so excited to finally have a soap that doesn't leave my face red after using it! It's gentle and moisturizing, which is exactly what I need.

  AFTER: I stopped using barsoap several years ago due to breakouts and I have tried other Adovia products so I really was eager to see if I could use this soap and have no issues. I was stunned. The first use and my face was NOT dry and scratchy afterwards, my body didnt itch. Again another reason i had to stop barsoaps. Instead it has a great clean smell and my face not only got very clean but my redness has went down, i felt as if i had lotion on my face as it was super smooth feeling. My body feels less dry and so honestly im am stoked to use this as a daily routine. This just might be my new soap of choice. Worth every penny!

  AFTER: Before purchasing this product for myself, I asked myself if I needed another mascara. With the plethora of drugstore mascaras, there are certainly plenty of &#34;fails&#34;. I did some simple research before I bought, so I will share them with you along with my own experience.I didn't compare ingredients or anything like that, but simply abused the power of Google and YouTube, and searched through countless reviews. You might think that's a lot of work put into a mascara, but hey, that's just how women shop, right? Anyway, I found that it was very well liked among all the people who tried it. It's even sold in Costco in a 3 pack!My experience is that this formula is drier than those of say, Loreal Voluminous Carbon Black. The bristles are rubber and rather short, but a good amount of them. They can get product gooped on it, but just make sure you scrape some off on the rim before applying. It really doesn't clump very easily. Of course, any mascara can clump, but this one is really nice about being hard to. It definitely builds volume, and I'd say about 150% (not 200% as packaging says). If you have thin lashes, this will emphasize lashes by darkness (I bought Very Black) and slight thickness. Length-wise, this is only decent. Not crazy like some other Covergirl or Maybelline, or Loreal mascaras can be, but WITHOUT CLUMPS!Application tip: The wand is curved, so I'll call it concave and convex for the the respective side of the wand. The convex side (bulging out?) is great for lengthening, and the concave is fantastic for bottom lashes. Use the convex on your upper lashes to define them easily, and the concave on the bottom, for a great smudgeless application of the shorter bottom lashes. Try it!Personally, I'd rather take no clumps and fast application over high volume and lengthened spider lashes. That's just personal preference.

  AFTER: I am very picky about mascara because I have long eyelashes and most of the time the mascara ends up on my face due to smearing etc., This mascara doesn't do that and goes on very easily.  I love it!!

  AFTER: I like the smell of this product, it's a bit sticky. I really don't know what to say other than we shall see how beneficial this product will be for my hair. I have been using it on my edges for a week now.UPDATE 4/2/13The product is working a wonders on my edges. My edges are thicker than ever, they were previously damaged from the over wear of wigs. My hair is noticeably thicker as well. I can tell that it is growing. I am enjoying it overall!

  AFTER: This oil has a thick sticky consistency. It has almost no smell. There's a faint scent that is sort of waxy... sort of reminds me of how unscented face products and lipsticks smell. It doesn't smell like any kind of foody oil though...the scent isn't gross in my opinion. It's great for hair too, but I think it's amazing on skin. Helps with softening up underye bags.

  AFTER: This is not the best Mascara ever.  Just so you know, the best is the basic mascara made by ColoreScience. It's perfect. You get long, long lashes, no clumping, the wand is so good you should never throw it away. Just clean it with rubbing alcohol every now and then and use it instead of whatever wand you find inside any other mascara you are using, which you shouldn't be. ColoreScience is the best. But boy, does this come close.I don't want too much "volume." How thick should your eyelash be before you start looking like Tammy Faye Baker.  We want length and color. If your lashes are so sparse you look like Minnie Mouse, buy artificial lashes or, even better, get them individually applied by a make up artist for special occasions. But don't clunk up your lashes so they look gummy. This gives the right amount of lengthening and thickening, even if you put it on with a heavy hand.CoverGirl Clump Crusher goes on easily. To challenge their "no clumping" claim, I slathered on four coats.  Two coats of mascara should be the limit. Three...you're pushing it. Four...get your diploma, you are a Clown College Graduate.  But even four layers didn't make my lashes stumpy or weird. They were starting to look overdone, so I stopped there. If you wait a few minutes and let the mascara dry, you can use your lash curler...even a heated one, without creating a mess. YOu get a little flaking and flecking, but not too bad. Still, it's always better to do the curling first. I like the brush, it has an interesting angle and the bristles sweep away a lot of excess product when you brush it on.  The curve follows the curve of the eye, so one stroke goes from one end of the lid to the other.  Straight brushes can be tricky because they reach only a portion of the lashes. When you go back to do the middle and other end, some lashes end up with too little, some too much mascara.By the way, I got a great tip from a make up artist:  If you use eyeliner on the inner eyelids, your eyes look smaller and harder.  Instead, use white or very light blue. It makes your eyes open up and look bigger and younger.  Use it on the inner lids top and bottom. Also nothing gets rid of eyebags (I don't mean temporary puffiness from staying up late or partying, but real undereye suitcases), so save your money for the surgery. BUT caffeine does temporarily provide a little bit of shrinkage. Soak cotton balls in cold coffee left from breakfast and place on the bags, lean back and relax for 20 minutes.  It should make a difference. I have also heard that Preparation H works, but I believe the formula has been changed.  Perhaps we should be checking out the hemmerhoid cream reviews!Thanks for your patience. I think this mascara is a good deal, easy to use whether you use make up often or only occasionally, and is fairly foolproof.

I will be buying more colors from this brand not just because they're cheap, but because they have a great palette of colors from which to choose, too!

  AFTER: Update: nowhere on this package does it say Night Cream. I didn't know this was a night cream until I saw a magazine ad. I'm disappointed I didn't know because now I have a cupboard full of night stuff and nothing for the day. The only downside to buying Olay products is the lack of directions for use across the board. I think they need to update their packaging to include some directions.I don't have problem skin, and I've always taken good care of it. So, it's not like I've gone from non-existent skin care to trying a product and seeing great results. However, since switching to the Olay brand, I've noticed simply fantastic results. I'm in my 30's, and this product helps reduce the onslaught of tiny wrinkles and age spots that have started to invade my face. I have parched skin, and usually the thickest of hardcore moisturizers don't even do the trick. With this, though it doesn't say it's specifically for dry skin, a small amount does the trick every time (I do use a Regenerist serum underneath, so that could be one reason it works so well). I didn't even notice a heavy fragrance until reading reviews, so that isn't a deterrent for me. I love how soft and smooth my skin feels. I look radiant even sans makeup. I've never been able to say that about my skin since it tends to look dull and lifeless.My only complaint is it doesn't have an SPF. That's a real downer for me since I have extremely fair skin and absolutely have to wear sunscreen when I leave my house. And, with my skin looking refreshed and dewy, I can go without foundation more often. I do not like having to swap it out with another moisturizer that has an SPF on the days I forgo makeup. But then, this is my first time using the Olay brand, so who knows, maybe there is a great moisturizer in this line that has SPF.Overall, even without the SPF, I recommend this. I love the results I've seen with this brand, especially since I wasn't expecting it to perform any better than the other brands I've used.

  AFTER: I will freely admit that i am a bit obsessed with soaps and bath products. I love trying different scents and brands and probably have enough body wash to last a lifetime (ok so that may be a bit of an overstatement bit I do have alot). My general preference isn't usually bar soap but was kindly sent this soap to test out so I figured it was worth a try.This is the Adovia Moisturizing Mineral Soap.This is a face/body soap containing a combination of Dead Sea minerals and trace elements derived from Dead Sea Salt.The smell is an extremely pleasant and fresh scent. Not to mild and not to overpowering either. Just the perfect amount of perfume.It's very moisturizing and lathers well. Leaves you clean and smooth without stripping away to many of your skins natural oils. I also really enjoyed that it didn't leave any of that funky filmy residue that so many soaps do.It's a fairly good size but at $11 a bar I suggest you not use it as your main soap.... especially if you live with multiple people.Overall I give it an 8/10. I throughly enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone seeking a nourishing and effective soap!I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free usingTomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.

It had such a clean and fresh smell, I couldn't wait to open it and try it!The soap is infused with 100% dead sea salt, contains over 21 minerals for skin health and skin beauty, and is essential to skin function due to its ingredients.After using the soap, it didn't leave any residue on my skin whatsoever. My skin felt clean and refreshed. I used it in the shower, and it made the bathroom smell so good!I love that this soap has natural ingredients, making it great for your skin. If your skin is in need of more moisture, be sure to try this out. I'm in love with it!

  AFTER: Something was just off about my appearance when I was using Very Black (or whatever the darkest black shade is). I'm Asian and my hair is a very dark brown with a reddish warm hue, so even though subtle, the blackest black shades just looked a bit artificial. This Black Brown shade is amazing. I love that my makeup looks softer, more natural, and without any clumps in sight - are they natural? Is she wearing mascara? I love it. The brush is just perfect, too - very rarely make mistakes and I manage to get every hair I want to. Sometimes reaching the hairs near the corners can be frustrating with other types of brushes, but this gets every one, and I don't end up with clumps in the process!

  AFTER: I'm a fan of Cover Girl products because they work well and aren't overly expensive.  This mascara doesn't disappoint - it goes on smoothly with the brush and doesn't clump on my lashes.  I like that it colors and defines my lashes without thickening them too much, since I'm a little too old to pull off a dramatic super-huge-eyelash look.This mascara stays on all day without flaking or ending up smeared under my eyes, and it washes off easily with soap and water or cold cream.My only complaint is the odd shape of the container.  It's small on one end and top heavy so it wants to fall over, and angled at the other end so it can't stand on that end either.  And it's too fat in diameter to fit in the openings of my makeup case.  I do like the bright green color, since that makes it easy to find in a purse.

It is a solid smooth bar that is a decent size and has lasted me for over a week now. It doesn't leave any weird film or residue on my skin. It actually moistures my skin and makes it feel so smooth! It makes me feel clean after without drying out my skin. It does have a very light nice scent to it that is not overwhelming in any way. It lathers well.  On top of all of that, it's infused with 100% dead sea salts which benefits your skin. Makes me feel so luxurious using it. I would highly recommend!

  AFTER: I bought this to use with the oil cleansing method. I am still experimenting with my oil ratios. But I am already in love, my skin is becoming more clear than it has been since I was 10. Castor oils is the actual cleanse soap, in the oil cleansing method, it can be drying so you have to find out just how much you need for your own personal cleansing routine. I enjoy Now brand, I just wish they carried an organic version. I may buy another castor oil when I am out that is organic.

With the concentrator attachment it takes me 5 minutes to dry my hair, 7-8 if I'm styling it using the blow dryer. The end of the dryer is a little warm after use, it won't burn you. But I do recommend letting it cool off on the counter for a couple minutes before putting it away.

  AFTER: I use a lot of natural oils, and castor oil is a regular player. Keep in mind it can be drying on its own so it needs to be mixed with a carrier oil-I use sweet almond oil and put a few drops of lavender oil in as well. It is a little thicker than some oils but once mixed it is fine. I can already see my over-plucked eyebrows growing back and plan on using it as a hair/scalp treatment as well. I noticed some have complained about the smell, but I have barely noticed it-sort of a light nutty smell. Just mix a few drops of essential oil in and you can have whatever scent you want. Lavender oil is also good for hair growth so I use that.

  AFTER: So I bought this because I heard it was a great growth aid. I put it on my edges for a few weeks last year and my edges did grow but not as much as I thought it would. So I gave a little to my aunt to try (the little lasted her for MONTHS) , and she loved it! She has been bragging about it and she is def going to buy her own. The oil is very thick but surprisingly it didn't last me that long, because I used it in a few of my hair concoctions. My NOW oils lasted me an entire year but this oil was gone after a few months. Luckily, I gave some to my granny, so she still had some left. So I asked her for it  this year and she gave it to me and I was able to use the rest of it just recently to make a hot oil treatment and to use it on my edges. I love the way it makes my hair look and feel. It is a great oil and it does wonders in hair concoctions, deep conditioners and hot oil treatments. You should def buy this to add to your already existing products. I made a hair concoction last year with a bunch of ingredients and this year I finally decided to use it and my hair had a growth spurt. It was amazing how quickly my hair grew and the Jamaican black castor oil def had a lot to do with it because I had used most of the bottle for the concoction. Jamaican black castor oil + MTG + Essential oils + base oils + mega tek + wild growth oil makes one hell of a growth aid. Thanks for reading.

  AFTER: I bought this to use for OCM (Oil Cleansing Method) and I LOVE IT. I bought it along withNOW Foods Jojoba Oil Pure, 4 ounce, and I also use it with olive oil. Usually I combine 1-part Castor Oil with 2 or 3-parts of Olive Oil (since the castor needs to be diluted with carrier oils)... and I'll use the jojoba as a moisturizer.I also use this for my hair.Something to consider is that castor oil can be drying if used alone, or if there is more castor oil than other (carrier) oils. So be careful! This oil is GREAT, but only if you don't use too much. :)Love it, and will buy more once this huge bottle runs out. Did I mention I love the price?? Huge bottle, great price. Love it! :)

  AFTER: I needed a dryer just to keep at our cabin, so I wanted something cheaper that still worked well. I had decent luck with a Revlon dryer before so I went with this model. This is cheap, but does not work well at all. The power cord gets hotter than the dryer. It is surprisingly loud, even for a hair dryer. It takes at least 3 times the amount of time to dry my hair compared to my Rusk dryer, and twice as longer than an older Revlon dryer I have as a spare. Until a few days ago, I had almost waist length hair. I do understand that longer hair takes longer to dry, but this took 30 minutes and I gave up before completely dry. My arm hurt. What really chaps my pants is that I paid almost $30 for this at Ulta. Unfortunately, the exchange period closed before I got to the cabin to use this, so I am stuck with it. If I didn't cut my hair to shoulder length recently, I would probably just throw this away and spend the extra money on another Rusk.

  AFTER: Let me start by saying that I do not use night creams, and I do not use this product regularly.  I use it as my Winter time  moisturizer when I go out at night.  I don't use it during the day because it doesn't have any SPF.  Therefore, I can't comment on its long term effects.  But I have to say, it does have pretty decent instant effects.  It does plump up my facial lines and wrinkles, and minimizes them better than any other drugstore wrinkle cream I have used so far. (And I have tried several).  I will most likely purchase this again.

  AFTER: This mascara is okay. As it claims, it adds volume and a little length without clumping. The biggest drawback, however, is that it starts flaking after a couple of hours, leaving a residue under my lower lashes. I usually use Covergirl's "professional" mascara, and although I don't think it provides quite as much volume as this one does, it doesn't flake or smear, no matter how long I wear it. Every other mascara I've tried does one or the other. This one didn't smear, but flaking was an issue.

  AFTER: This lotion does what it says.  It's really, really moisturizing and soothing for dry winter skin.  I've got a few dry patches that only Aveeno seems to be able to sort out.  It is absolutely unscented, as well.  I don't tend to like unscented lotions, so I add some perfume oil to mine, and it still works really well.  This is absolutely essential for me in the winter.

  AFTER: Decided to try it out due to the rave reviews on Reddit's /MakeupAddiction. It does not deserve the hype. I didn't like it at all.It gave me very stiff, clumpy lashes. After a short period of wear it began to flake off and my lash-line became irritated and itchy. This is when I decided it had to go, and I took it off.I've never had an allergic reaction to a mascara so I'm guessing it was due to this product and not an overall sensitivity. I have full lashes, maybe it would be better for somebody with thin lashes, I kinda doubt it though.For a product named clump crusher, and then produced clumps, I mean come on. 1 star. I can't think of a mascara I've liked less.

  AFTER: I love the heavy mascara but I am careful to remove excess by 'batting my eyelashes&#34; against a tissue both by looking up and down.  That removes the excess and lets it dry carefully.  Still have to separate those eyelashes sometimes, though.  Still, can't beat the coverage.

  AFTER: My only complaint is that I use the concentrator attachment regularly and the attachment snaps on really loosely, so the concentrator (the attachment that you use to narrow the heat concentration) rotates and changes angle multiple times when I'm trying to blow my hair dry. It's pretty annoying, but I'm learning to deal with it. Overall, it was really cost effective and it's small so it will be good for traveling, and it's pretty powerful too.

  AFTER: Jamaican Black Castor Oil is a good product. I use it on my hair. It leaves my hair soft and moist and I've heard castor oil help to promote hair growth which was the main reason for me purchasing it. I have notice that my hair is thicker since using it I have been using it more than three months now. Will continue to use it and see what results I will continue to yield. Good product.

  AFTER: This is definitely one of the better mascaras I've tried in a long time. It goes on smooth, so clumps are pretty hard to get (unless maybe you put on more than two thick coats) and it adds volume to the lashes. Although it's not waterproof, I wore it out in the snow/rain much of the day and in the evening there wasn't a single smudge. That never happened with the other mascara I used. The mascara removed easily with a regular eye make up remover. I have sensitive eyes and many mascaras cause my eyes to become itchy or they dry out my lashes. I didn't have either of those problems with this mascara. So far, this one's a winner.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE 2/25/13: After using this mascara a few months now, I still like it, but I've changed my rating to 4 stars instead of 5 because although there aren't really any clumps, it tends to flake a little or smudge later in the day.

  AFTER: As I have dry skin, I personally do not prefer to use soap because it makes my skin more drier. I have previously tried their Mud Soap which i loved using it.That's why I expected a lot about this soap as well. To be honest, I am slightly disappointed about this soap! I know many people like this soap and even saw some videos where they used it directly on the face!! I can finally tell you that this soap works just like the regular body soap.It does clean very well,although it dries my skin like hell! I dare to use it on my face though! It smell nice like regular soap and this soap last for a long time i guess because it still in my bathroom! &#9786; One more thing I would like to mention that I use to wash my clothes with this soap, lol! and it does clean well and smell good as well.Overall, I think this soap works just like regular soap and kinda dry me out.So I would probably not going to repurchase it again!

  AFTER: Besides the horrendous smell, this is actually a great product.  I use it for my skin and I massage my gums with it.  (It's suppose to help fight gingivitis), but only time will tell.  I tried "oil pulling" with this oil but it's just way too think and the smell and taste reminds me of motor oil.Apparently this oil has tons of benefits. There are some who take it orally but I just can't do it.  I use it on my skin for pimples, itch, rash and so on.  I use it as a face mask every couple days.  Basically just slap this on my face for about 15 minutes and rinse it off with cold water and facial soap.  And my skin is glowing.  And I'm a guy. LOL..Did some more research and it apparently removes "moles".  It's been about 3 days since I applied it on my moles and I really don't see any difference.  There is another method where you mix it with baking soda and apply it to the mole after to "scrape it", but I'll pass on that.  Not really sure about scratching my moles until it bleeds and then apply the oil and baking powder on it.For the price, this is one of the best investment I've made on skin care product.  I tried those other more expensive gimmicks that don't even come close to the results I get from this oil.Will update when my ugly moles starts falling off. That would be a freaking miracle.

  AFTER: I am not usually a fan of bar soap, so I was skeptical when Adovia sent me this soap to try, but I am completely converted!  I absolutely love this soap.  Not only does it leave my skin soft and smooth, it smells AMAZING.  I don&#8217;t like super strong smells, but this smells clean and nice without being overpowering like perfume.  Plus, I have super sensitive skin, so some products that I can use on my body, I can&#8217;t use on my face because it will break out.  This doesn&#8217;t  - my face is perfectly fine with this as an in-shower cleanser.  Love it!  I will definitely be purchasing this again!The price is outstanding and it lathers really, really well.  I will definitely be purchasing again in the future!

  AFTER: I love love love this dryer! I have blond, overprocessed, long, fine hair and this dryer leaves it so smooth! I can't believe it! It dries my hair in five minutes, compared to twenty minutes with my old dragon dryer (you know the one, practically spits fire and weighs a ton!).  This does blow fast, even on low, but that is the great thing about it! The dryer is so LIGHT! 14.8 ounces to be exact! I just can't tell you enough about why I love it! The shipping was free, and the price was half what it is in the store.  If you have fragile hair, this is for you. If you have thick hair, this is for you. If you have frizzy hair, fine hair, any hair.. well you get the idea!

  AFTER: It doesn't feel oily and it dries in under a minute! It's practically unscented and makes my skin  smooth, soft, and protected. This is the best affordable lotion I have ever found. However it says call poison control if ingested. wtf. The skin is an absorbent organ! Humans can die if their skin comes in contact with poision and absorbs it! So this warning label made me very wary because even if some harmful substance is only present in small amounts in this lotion, there's a chance that there will be build up in my body as I have been using this for years. I'm presently looking for a new body lotion. Any suggestions, fellow reviewers? please leave a comment.

  AFTER: I was lucky to get to try out the Adovia Moisturizing Mineral Soap. I love the smell of it as well as the way it leaves my skin smooth and moisturized. I honestly didn't find a con to this soap at all, I did notice a few pimples that popped up a day or so after use but I would have to say that is probably due to the salt pulling the impurities out of my skin. I will continue to use this bar of soap and update my blog review once the bar is used up! I have super sensitive skin so knowing I didn't have an allergic reaction to this wonderful soap just makes me love it even more.

  AFTER: After reading reviews of this product, I was a little leary about getting this. But I went with the purchase and was excited when it arrived in the mail. I tried it that very night I got home and I love it. Granted no, I can't see any results, but there is something about the roller that is a stress reliever. I've used it twice now along with the St. Ives Timeless Skin Collagen Facial Moisturizer and my skin glows!! I am 32 years old and wanted to do some &#34;preventative maintenance&#34; on my skin and I think it shows. Others mentioned to disinfect the product BEFORE and AFTER each use. These are little needles that are puncturing your skin. Infections will happen if you're not smart about disinfecting your face and the roller.

  AFTER: Castor Oil is great for the scalp and that is why I purchased it. I love to put a tad bit of oil on my scalp right after the shower to relieve my dry itchy scalp. It also softens the hair, and gets rid of dandruff (or itchy scalp). Castor Oil is also good on dry skin.

  AFTER: This is a face and body soap, but I've only used it for face. I'm very careful with the soaps I use for my face, but this one has not given any problem at all! The smell is nice and subtle, very gentle and nose-friendly, specially when flowery or other strong scents are to penetrating to use so close to your face. The texture is very nice, it's soft on the skin, yet, it cleanses and moisturizes well. I like how my skin feels after using it :)

  AFTER: I like all of Covergirl's Lashblast line.  I have used many brands of mascara in all price ranges and I prefer these.  I love mascara and use it daily and this brand is my go to.  I also use the Lashblast Volume (Orange tube) and love it.  The wand is nice and the mascara lasts all day.  It is not clump-free, but it is less clumpy than most mascara.

  AFTER: I like it, but it has to be thinned out for my use because it is too thick. I always mixed it with other oils and conditioner when using on hair, and other oils when using on scalp. I really didn't care for it on my scalp and after two tries gave up.I love the strong earthy scent. It kind of reminds me of dirt. I think the oil is very moisturizing when mixed with other things, and helps give hair nice shine and sheen when used with conditioner for a deep conditioning treatment. For me I think this is not a product I need to use or will repurchase. I can get the same effects using coconut oil in my conditioners. Despite that I like this oil and would recommend it.

  AFTER: I've spent my entire life looking for a mascara like this! I have thick, medium-length lashes, so I need a bit of a boost in the length department without insane, clumpy thickening. Every mascara I've tried that claims to define lashes without clumping has ended in one thing: clumping. I wind up having to go through my lashes with a metal eyelash comb in order to avoid looking like a drag queen. I've tried so, so, SO many mascaras (I can't even guess how many), from high-end lines to drugstore brands, with no real luck. But the second I put on this mascara, I realized it was time to dump every other tube in my collection. If they discontinue this line, I'll be heartbroken, because I already know this is my mascara holy grail.Update 4/24/13: I still love this mascara, but I have discovered that you can't sleep with it on. Whenever I do, I wake up with black smudges under my eyes. Yes, I know I shouldn't sleep in mascara--I'm not reducing my rating based on this, but merely pointing it out since I used to sleep inCoverGirl Lash Exact Mascara: Black Brown #910all the time with no problem. That being said, it's still my favorite mascara!!

  AFTER: I haven't been using this oil for long, but I am an instant devotee! About me: African American & Native American; natural, kinky curly hair; acne prone, dry skin; 28 years old.I tried this oil before, when I first stopped straightening my hair. I hadn't quite gotten acquainted to the needs of my hair at the time, and tried slathering it on with nothing else. That was a massive fail - it was too thick - no comb was getting through that!Fast forward two years, as I began the oil cleansing method (OCM) with good results, trying only coconut oil. During this time, I started to read how people love castor oil the most for the OCM, so I gave it a try again. This time as suggested by others, I mixed it 50/50 with a lighter oil to make it spreadable - extra virgin olive oil. The results were MAGICAL.My face instantly fell in love - removing all dirt, grime, make-up, dry skin, and leaving my face supple and delicious, and karate chopping the few acne spots I had. That lead me to trying it on my body as a moisturizer. OMG - DELICIOUS SKIN! Mind you, I have terribly flaky, dry legs. BE GONE, said the castor oil!Then I tried it on my kinky, curly hair - BUTTER! It made my hair softer than it has ever been in my entire life. My hair was in a good state already, but there was some minor breakage every time I detangled or manipulated my hair. Not any more!The best part about this - there is NO GREASINESS. I mean NONE! No more stains on the clothes, no more greasy head rests in the car... I am in awe! BUY IT!*Drops the mic and exits stage-left*

  AFTER: it shipped fast, and was as promised.  i love that it's lightweight and can dry my thick, curly, long hair in about 10 mins (which is about 20 mins faster than my last blow dryer) without causing frizzies (when using the diffuser, which was included, along with a concentrator) or my arms needing a break.  the only time i've had my hair dried faster was at Gene Juarez with what i'm assuming is much more expensive equipment.  for under $30 i can live with the toggle buttons where they are.  i turned it off once by accident, and just repositioned my hand after that and it was not an issue.

  AFTER: Before purchasing JBCO I researched it for about a year.  WHY OH WHY did it take me so long to purchase?!!!!  This is a must have staple within your head to toe daily beauty regime!  It has a faint peanutty type of smell, but it's nothing that I can't deal with.  When I'm using this on my scalp and hair, whether it's before bed or styling for the day, once I use it, I spray my hair with Palmer's Olive Oil with Vitamin E hair spray because it has a nice clean smell that gives my hair that high gloss sheen all day long.  You will see results with this product so be patient.  Everyone's hair grows at a different pace.  It also depends on how much and how often you apply this product.  I also use it on my eyelashes and around my eyes for my night moisturizer, as well as for blemishes, dry cracked skin, cuts, burns, it is an all purpose beauty secret.  A little goes a long way.  BUY IT, USE IT AND SPREAD THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT IT ~ ENJOY!!!

  AFTER: I was losing my hair every day during the shower, while I comb my hair and so and so. I ordered this oil (delivery was very fast), the same day I received I put an small amount in my finger and give a 3 minutes massage in the scalp and I let it dry on my hair hours before I go to bed because this oil is very STICKY and smell very BAD, and I dIdn't want to leave stains on my pillow.  Same day I put some oil into my hair shampoo  and conditioner bottle.  So next morning I rinse my hair as usual I put shampoo and conditioner and I noticed there is no hair in the drain and nothing came off when I comb my hair.  Nothing else but no hair loss. NO MIRACLES.  Good for me, Not good for other people.  I will continue using this product and I will put my feedback in about 30 days to see if this oil is really working or not.

  AFTER: This color is so pretty. It is full of gold glitter mixed with other colors of glitter to make it stunning. It looks really vibrant when looking at it on the brush, but is actually more see through than I was expecting when on the nail. I put on two coats and it is super sparkly, but more translucent than I prefer but love the color anyways. It is not super bold or flashy, a little more subtle. and is a great everyday color without being too bold

  AFTER: For several years now I have been buying organic, all-natural lotions, shampoos, and bar soaps.  I was paying over $10 a bottle for Nature's Gate and other brands, but they leave my skin greasy and they don't really absorb, causing me to have to reapply frequently.  I recently tried this product out at work since we buy Aveeno to keep in the bathrooms there, and I was surprised to find it absorb better than Nature's Gate and it has absolutely no smell.  I have very sensitive and very dry skin, and this lotion keeps my skin soft for hours.The true test came when I decided to visit the Skin Deep cosmetics database and compare the numbers.  This lotion was rated a 2, which is pretty low for a non-organic brand, and my Nature's Gate was rated a 4!  I could not believe the number was lower, meaning that it's actually less toxic than the organic brand, according to the database.  I went out and purchased a bottle for myself.  It is pricey, but cheaper than organic and much nicer on my skin.

  AFTER: Unpacked item, which I felt was well packaged, and sanitary.  It did not have elaborate instructions; basically a small paragraph on the side of the box, but that was fine.  The item did not appear cheap to me like others stated.  I mean&#8230;what do you expect for $10 anyhow?  It did seem smaller than expected, but no big deal.  I washed my face and rolled as directed, 10 rolls in each spot.  I bought this because of previous use with an acupuncture mat (aka Bed of Nails), gently puncturing yourself definitely increases blood flow and endorphin production.  So I can sort of see how this would stimulate collagen growth.  My face turned red, and felt like mild sunburn.  I did my hands and neck too.  I didn&#8217;t really notice anything but irritation at first.  Did my regular routine and went to bed.  This morning, there is no doubt it did something.  The lines around my mouth (I smoked for 17 yrs) are way less apparent, same with the lines on my forehead.  My left hand has tiny red dots, like broken blood vessels?  I may have pushed too hard, but I didn&#8217;t think I was when I was doing it.  My skin feels tight, but like that feeling you get from sunburn.  I don&#8217;t wear heavy makeup, or concealers.  I use a lot of moisturizers, especially Organic Coconut Oil on my fac, hair and body at night (anyone that never has tried coconut oil needs to go get some now!! I used Spectrum Organic Coconut Oil, you can get it at a local grocery store-more info check out my blogs [...] ) during the day I used a tinted SPF moisturizer, it&#8217;s very light.  My skin definitely has a glow today!  May just be irritation but whatever it is, it looks better, so I&#8217;m happy with that!  I think this thing works and honestly didn&#8217;t expect to notice such a difference after first use; I will use it again for sure!  I can see how people with sensitive skin would not like it.  I have a high pain tolerance, I also epilate and wax, so this isn&#8217;t that bad to me.  I&#8217;m hoping it reduces the size of the pores on my cheeks.  And I&#8217;m going to keep using it on my hands.  I&#8217;m glad I found this thing!  I will probably use at most, 1x a week because of how tight my skin feels.  Glad I didnt' go with 2mm yet.

  AFTER: OK I have always been a product junkie, spending too much on creams and lotions of all sorts. Never thought to use something as simple as an oil. I feel like I have just come across a gold mine! I initially purchased the product for my man once I read about its benefits in reversing baldness. As I researched a little more, I found many more advantages such as longer and thicker lashes and brows, tightening and softening skin, eliminating wrinkles and stretch marks, removing callouses and warts and other fungal infections, treating acne, shinier healthier hair....etc. So far I have only used it for a couple of days, and I am already blown away. The softening effect on my skin is nothing like I have ever experienced. Never again will I spend money on expensive face creams. Granted, the oil is a little on the thick side, so a little goes a long way. But if you put a couple of dabs around the eyes and massage them on your wrinkles before bed and very little before you go out, you will see the effects almost immediately! I also bought almond oil (since now I am believer in the miraculous powers of oil) just to mix it with since it has a much lighter consistency, and also high benefits to the skin.Another amazing effect is on my callouses on the soles of my feet, as I run a lot. Absolutely better than any foot cream I've ever used. I massage it in nightly and wear socks right before bed. Instant gratification! Been using it on my stretch marks too around my butt, and I already see changes!All I can say is stop spending money on name brands and go for the source. You will not be disappointed!

I have long, blonde eyelashes & this make them look even longer, curls them & makes them look thick all while separating them & really doesn't leave any clumps!!I absolutely recommend this mascara if you're not into the clumpy eyelash look. You can use 1 or 2 coats to make them look natural & 3-5 coats to make them look thicker & blacker. Love this mascara!! &#60;3I used to use the Maybelline falsies nascar which is terrible compared to this mascara. You will really love this wand&#8230;

  AFTER: Most people forget about their hands when using sunscreen, but your hands can be more of a giveaway to your age than your face. This lotion provides long lasting moisturization, as well as good sun protection for every day exposure. One pump on my hands soaks in quickly, what little scent there is dissipates after a few minutes, and my skin is moisturized without feeling greasy.

  AFTER: Right away when I took it out of the package you can smell such a wonderful scent. It's hard to describe but it was quite strong but not overbearing to where I didn't want to smell it. I actually kept it on my desk for a day and it was pleasant to catch whiffs of it before I used it.I took it in the shower and I loved the smell. The feeling of the soap bar on my skin was nice. There is just always something nice about a product that has minimal chemicals in it. I felt like it didn't leave that nasty soapy residue a bunch of cheap soap bars leave on your skin. I have to constantly apply deodorant throughout the day. I don't have a sweating problem but I my underarm sweat smells a bit. I have tried clinical strength deodorants but they barely work. I have been washing my underarms with this soap and I swear it helps out a TON. I have noticed my underarms don't smell that bad anymore. You know what would be awesome? I could only hope that Adovia comes out with their very own deodorant because I think it would be a big success. I totally recommend this dead sea salt soap bar because it moisturizes your skin. It makes you feel good after using it. I prefer to use this on my body and I also use the dead sea mud soap for my face especially. I think having both bars of soap have been quite beneficial to my skin's health. The benefits of dead sea salt are too great for anyone not to consider adding it to their daily skin care regiment.

  AFTER: I received Dead Sea Salt in exchange for honest review from Tomoson. I wanted to review the soap because it was natural. The soap has a pleasant, light smell. The product helps remove dirt and other impurities from the body. The soap also helps moisturize your skin. I definitely will purchase again in the future.

  AFTER: I absolutely love this mascara. I love the shape of the brush, it makes it easy to get to the base of my lashes, which I need because of my very blonde eyelashes. It doesn't clump up on me, and the brush is the perfect size. It makes my lashes look great! I've tried a lot of mascara brands with a lot of different formulas and brush shapes. This is definitely in my top 5 favorites!

  AFTER: Olay Micro-Sculpting Cream is collagenic -- that is, it can block your pores -- so users may experience milia, those hard little white dots/deposits under the skin, or acne.  When I first tried this product, I woke up the next morning with milia dotting my cheeks.  I immediately stopped using the cream.  A few weeks later, I decided to try it again.  This time, it took three days for my skin to react.  I figured then that perhaps my skin just needed to get used to it, so I waited a while before starting up again.  And I was right.  I'm able to use it now, although I'm very careful to use the cream only at night and another, noncollagenic moisturizer by day.  I'm still undecided if I will continue once I run out.  My skin feels great in the morning, but I remain wary.Since I use mainly unscented products, I was also surprised by the strength of the scent.  My husband can tell I applied the cream from across the room.  But if you tend to use scents, you probably won't find it overpowering.  Don't even bother trying this if you have adverse reactions to scents; it will be a waste of your money.I bought this product because I read that it provides the best results for the least amount of money.  Although that may be the case, the drawbacks are something to consider as well.  I recommend buying the smallest jar you can when first trying this and see whether your skin can handle it.  I was able to sensitize my own skin, but you may not be able to.  If you have oily or sensitive skin, beware.  Otherwise, it should make your skin feel smooth and supple.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann

  AFTER: I have been using this cream for over 2 years, it has virtually changed my life.  I was always suffering with dry and red skin in the winter and then oily skin in the summer.  Once I purchased this cream which happened to be in the winter, my sore red sensitive dry skin immediately felt saturated with moisture without any stinging or acne breakouts.  I immediately felt happy and relieved to have found a cream that worked so well.  I continued to use this cream for months and began noticing my skin was softer and smoother as well, I was so happy to stop stressing my skin out with products that irritated and stung my skin.  I thought when summer came I would have to switch creams but it turns out that this cream was fine for me in the summer as well.  I found that I only use it at night and in the morning I use the Olay with SPF in the day.  In the winter I use this cream both at night and in the morning over my SPF.  It truly works for me.  I am 46 and still occasionally get carded, no lie!  I also wanted to add that I have purchased generic versions of the microsculpting cream and once I read that the ingredients are the same I felt confident to try them, and all the generic versions I have tried work equally as good.  I believe it is the ingredients of course being identical to olays version.  I love this stuff!

  AFTER: I have been using this for over six months and I can see subtle differences. For point of reference, my fair, normal skin has been described by a recent aesthetician as "remarkably unlined" skin. This comment wasn't even qualified with a "for your age" which is over 40. I've taken really good care of my skin since about age 13. That, combined with the inability to tan, has laid a good foundation. This is to say, I don't have problems that I'm trying to correct, only prevent. I have noticed improvement on my neck, where I am beginning to get some creases, and also with the crows feet from smiling that were starting to form. Since I have no plans to quite smiling it was nice to see those results.As to the pain of it, I would say that you get used to the slight sting and it's worth it for the results. Make sure to roll slowly or you will make it more painful and risk breaking your skin. Slow and steady is the trick. I use it on my neck, too, where the skin is thin and while I wouldn't say it tickles it's also not cringe-worthy pain either.My routine is this: Every evening after my skin is clean I put on a good moisturizer on my face and neck. I spray the roller, which has been thoroughly washed after the previous use, with rubbing alchohol. I run the roller, GENTLY, multiple times in each direction using short strokes beginning at my forehead and working my way down to eyes, cheeks, smile brackets, and finishing at the neck. I finish off with a more emollient night cream. I live in Arizona where it's quite dry so this last step is due to that fact and not a requirement. Other than the addition of the roller I have not altered my skin care regimen. I do not use astringents because I don't need it and find it drying. I certainly would not spray my skin with rubbing alcohol. I have not changed my skin care regimen except to introduce the micro needle roller.After each and every use, be sure to thoroughly clean the roller per the instructions. This really amounts to running it under hot water which I do after use, not before. This is per the instructions included with the roller. I have my water heater set very high so I know the water is scalding hot. I run it under a gentle stream. After letting it air dry a few minutes I spray it a second time with rubbing alcohol before putting it in its holder to dry. I also leave the lid slightly askew to let air in. The times I've put the lid on tight I've noticed condensation and I don't want it to rust.I found good instructions (both for use and for cleaning up afterward) on YouTube to augment those coming with the roller. It is imperative that you don't share the roller. The instructions say this but please don't ignore that.I would recommend this product based on my experience. In fact, I got my mother one.

  AFTER: Great for combination skin type. I use a mix of Estee Lauder, Clinique, and SK-II skin care products plus this face cream, if I can only have one item, this is it.Can't remember exactly when and how I started using this cream, but I remember the day when I knew it was 'the one'. It was after one of my annual 12+ hours non-stop flights that normally made me look at least 5 years older thanks to the dry air and lack of sleep. During that flight I washed my face with just water then put on a good amount of this cream and repeated for another time. When I arrived at the destination and saw myself in a restroom mirror I couldn't believe my tired and blood-shot eyes that my face looked so smooth and fresh!It can feel a bit heavy for day time use, but not that bad when you carefully apply only a very thin layer. I've been using it as a night cream and cannot be happier with the result.

  AFTER: This is a mascara that I will purchase again. I loved the curved brush, it seperated all my lashes and reached every single one. The color is very black but I did not think it was too dark at all (I have fair skin and dark blonde hair). It stayed on all day and did not smudge which is always a good thing when it comes to mascara! I don't think it gave my lashes 200% more volume though, which is why I am giving it four stars instead of five.

Castor oils is the actual cleanse soap, in the oil cleansing method, it can be drying so you have to find out just how much you need for your own personal cleansing routine. I enjoy Now brand, I just wish they carried an organic version. I may buy another castor oil when I am out that is organic.

  AFTER: This body wash makes a mild lather, and I can even use it for shaving. I like to use it on a nylon scrub puff and I find I don't have to use a moisturizing lotion after I shower or bathe, but it doesn't feel oily or greasy. The gel is rather thick, so it sits on the puff very well. It is a bit better in the shower than the tub, seems to leave a bit of a residue if you bathe. The scent is mild, like oatmeal or oatmeal cookies.I have allergies to a lot of things, sensitivity to most fragrances, especially strong perfumey ones, and bar soap leaves a residue (we have hard water.) This is a nice, mild body wash and leaves my skin very soft.One of the ingredients, in fact, the major ingredient, is sodium laureth sulfate, which is a detergent, somewhat less strong than sodium lauryl sulfate, and there is some feeling that shampoos and gels should be sulfate-free, but it is a good lathering detergent and seems to be mild enough.

  AFTER: I blow dry my hair just about every other day and I hadnt purchased a new hair dryer in about 7 years (even though I used it all the time, I cannot think of the brand- I tossed it and now just cannot remember).I bought this because I was looking for a hair dryer with a diffuser and high temperature settings, I have very long hair and was just thinking about cutting drying time.I love the attachments, The dryer gets really hot and I can get my hair dry in about 5-8 minutes, rather than the 15 it was taking me before. Great quality dryer, especially for the price.Looks nice as well.I am very happy with my new hair dryer!

  AFTER: I apply a few drops of the serum to my "trouble spots (around eyes, mouth - laugh lines, and forehead-in between brows)" every other day and I feel it makes a big difference in smoothing out fine lines. It seems like it helps with collagen boosting too. I feel like I'm just barely starting to discover signs of aging at 31 years old, and it may be my entire skin care routine that's helping. This stuff does sting a bit (especially if I use it after derma-rolling - OUCH!), and it smells like burnt nuts, but it is working for me. I've been using it for 2 1/2 months and I keep the little bottles in the fridge. I'll definitely re-order this when I'm out!

  AFTER: I bought this out of curiosity without knowing what I am really purchasing .  And boy does this thing hurt when you roll it over your face!!!!  I would use it more often but it hurts too bad and it makes me sneeze continually.  It also punctured the skin on my nose to the point that it was bleeding.  I am sure it makes the product you put afterwards absorb faster because your skin is punctured.

  AFTER: Yep, that's what it does - dries hair. It's not horrible (especially for the price), but there's nothing special about it either. Pay no attention to the claim that it makes your hair shinier, because it doesn't. It didn't add volume, either. However, when I purchased this, I didn't expect either of the claims to hold up - I bought it to dry my hair, and it did...I purchased this in 2010, and had to toss it in the middle of 2013 because the cord started sparking when I plugged it in. I like hair dryers that get hot, but not *that* hot... so in the trash it went. That said, lasting 2 1/2 years at the price I paid is okay with me.

  AFTER: Dead Sea Salt has all sorts of minerals, but I was skeptical whether it would really make any difference in a soap. I have only used the soap a couple times so I can't comment on long term skin effects, but I can say the following things:1. The soap is super moisturizing. My skin was so soft after showering.2. It smells really nice (and neutral - my husband can use it without complaining...)3. The bar is solid. Other moisturizing bars disintegrate. This bar is holding up well in the shower.A few of the minerals in the soap are magnesium and potassium - both necessary for healthy skin and muscles. We soak in epsom salts (magnesium) for health so if the body can absorb any of these from the soap, it's probably a good thing.

So I purchased this a few times when I see it other places. I love it! It really does give you Doll eyelashes. They are really pretty! There isn't much to be said for the volume as the consistency of the product is kinda thin. But, you could always layer it. I never have much luck with both volume and length (even from products that claim to do both). I have used Diorshow, Buxom, and Yves Saint Laurent mascara and this is right up there with them IMO. My only complaint is that I do get some flaking from it later in the day sometimes.

  AFTER: The only thing that I found true about this product's description - it has stayed "clump free"... BUT it absolutely DOES NOT give 200 times the volume like the description says.

  AFTER: I am impressed. On a news program I heard about the new Ionic hair dryers. I already had a Revlon Ionic hair dryer, but it was several years old, and worked just fine, but the price of this one was so reasonable I thought I would give it a try. Well what they said about the new ones was correct. This really does dry your hair in half the time. It is better for your hair, as it dries your hair with less heat! Not sure how that works, but it does. Highly recommend this product!

UID: 22884
  BEFORE: <none>
  AFTER: The heat and cool air is wonderful, I like the cold blast button. There's an indicator light for the ions working like they should. It's attractive in color and style, as far as blow dryers are concerned. It comes with a point attachment and a diffuser. It has three temperatures and the cold blast. The air flow is sufficient, and the heat is not too hot so it burns but hot enough it dries quickly. I've noticed a lot less frizz in my curly hair and my best friend borrowed it and she has super fine straight hair and had it blow dry smooth without any static when she borrowed it.If I had but one complaint, and it's really a minor one: the product 'feels' cheap. i worry a little bit that it's not going to be sturdy over the long haul if I drop it or knock it around.Other than that, I like how it looks, it's light enough it's easy to hold, and I like how it works. I'd definitely recommend it, but I also recommend treating it carefully, because it does look like it won't take a beating very well. if you travel a lot of are hard on appliances like this, you might want to find one a bit 'sturdier' feeling.But I think you'll be pleased with how it does your hair and it's worth the price.

At first I thought I could replace Finacea (Rosacea Rx cream), but that's when I got into trouble...when I didn't use Finacea first.If used AFTER Finacea which really dries out the skin, especially around eyes and mouth...when used after (on top of settled Finacea), it makes my skin feel less tight and apparently has eased some fine lines...unreal!Retinol is murder on Rosacea-skin and most "wonder" products have retinol. This does not have retinol...TG!

  AFTER: Good moisturizer, but forget sculpting!  After 3 weeks use, you are supposed to see results of sculpting, butI only allowed  myself to be fooled. It does feel good on the skin and does moisturize, and has a very slightscent, very, very, I should say, because I would have liked a little more. Some like more, some like less., anywayall in all, it is good.

  AFTER: Yet another superb product from Adovia!  I have now tried 2 products from Adovia containing the dead sea salt minerals and I have not been disappointed in either one.  I have been using this bar of soap for 4 days now and my skin is so soft and I feel so much more clean when I get out of the shower now.  I live in a very old house that has TERRIBLE water with rust and even the water softener does not help.  Since I started using the Adovia products I received my hair and skin has been so much better!  Using this soap has actually even helped reduce my acne.This soap smells so clean and fresh; comes in a regular size bar and is a very silky smooth white color.  The moment I opened the box from Amazon I could smell it and it was like heaven :)  I love body products that are not heavily perfumed but just smell wonderfully fresh.  You can most definitely smell the ocean in Adovia products, and of course with all of the minerals from the Dead Sea Salts it is always good for your skin.This specific product retails for $11 on Amazon and although it may seem expensive for a bar of soap, the benefits FAR outweigh the costs if you appreciate the healthiness that comes along with using the product :)  Just check out the gorgeous photos of the sea salts that make the products!  Imagine being able to swim in that water every day and the health benefits it would bring!  Then just think of this soap and if you try it you will be hooked!***I received a complimentary product in exchange for an honest and open review***

  AFTER: Okay, I've been wearing this for 2 days now and I am loving it.  I have 5 different mascara's bc I wear mascara a lot but not too much other make up.  This one so far is my favorite.Here's why:1. It's cheap (almost always my #1 reason ha ha)2. It goes on smoothly with little to no clumping3. It's dark (love the black brown)4. The color of the tube is cute - green!There is not much to like about this product.  I'm glad I bought it.My 2nd favorite is NYX Doll Eye Mascara!

It cleans without stripping natural oils, and it keeps me from being all stinky- hey in Arizona you have to watch that in summer;)I love the light scent of this product, and all of Adovia's products really.. it is fresh and clean smelling without being overwhelming or too girly. Just the right scent.I am still using their shampoo and conditioner, so it is a great complement for all 3 together.Thanks again to Adovia for a great product!

  AFTER: I've been using this for the past 2 days and am very happy with the results.The color is evenly distributed by the brush so that when I use my lash curler they look very full with none of those annoying globs of mascara you have to pull off or smooth away. My only complaint is that I wish the applicator was a little thinner for better control.  I have small fingers (like a lot of women) and it's kind of a pain using the brush on the bottom row of lashes.The color is a true black and I haven't had to do any touch-ups since I applied it 10 hours ago, and my lashes still look great.UPDATE:  1/30/13I just had to update my original review to 5 stars after using it for over 3 weeks.The brush separates my lashes each and every day without any clogging, clumping or flaking. I've used other brands that have cost less and some that have cost 4 times as much and have never had such consistant and exceptional results. I keep waiting for it to fail but it never disappoints.As someone who has always used an eyelash curler, I'm used to having to feather my lashes each time I curl them - but not with this mascara. Not once. I put it on, use my curler and I'm done.  And they look fabulous!And as for my original complaint about the applicator being to thick - forgive me for being an idiot.  Who cares about a little inconvenience for brief minutes when the results are outstanding and last for hours. Not me anymore.

I use it every other day after a thorough face and neck cleansing and prior to applying evening products.

Maybe you're only supposed to use it on the scalp, because I used it on the length of my hair. I will keep buying it, because it is a good moisturizer for dry lips and skin, but does not do anything for my hair and makes my scalp itchy.

  AFTER: Adovia Moisturizing Mineral soap made my skin feel so soft, and very clean. I really like that Adovia Moisturizing Mineral soap leaves my skin feeling clean without leaving a residue like other soaps I tried before. My skin feels so soft that my husband noticed, and asked me what was I using. I liked it so much that I used the soap on my babies too! Their skin felt so soft, I mean their skin is soft already, but it made their skin feel even softer, and the scent lingered on them for a long time.I recommend Adovia Moisturizing Mineral Soap for any one that has dry, sensitive, or normal skin.Disclosure: I received Adovia Moisturizing Mineral Soap for review purposes. However the opinions expressed are 100% my own based on my experience with the product.

  AFTER: Cleansing every morning has become a spa like experience thanks to Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap. I work the Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap into a deep, rich lather and rub in small concentric circles around my face until it is completely covered in the Sea Salt Soap at which point I begin to rinse with cool to warm water until all traces of the soap have vanished.My skin has never felt so clean, and I am being completely honest with you when I tell you that washing my face has never been so pleasurable. I&#8217;ve used liquid face soap religiously for the past 10 years, at least, not a bar soap, but I am loving the results I&#8217;m getting from Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap. I used to only wash once per day, in the morning, because the liquid soap left my face feeling dry and tight, but with Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap, I wash morning and night.There is never a residue with Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap and my face feels refreshingly clean. Adovia&#8217;s bar soap lather is very light whereas the liquid soap I&#8217;d been using felt like there was always a layer left on my skin. I hadn&#8217;t noticed that leftover residue until I switched to Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap and I don&#8217;t think I will go back to a liquid cleanser again.The price point is right up my alley. At $11 a bar, I feel like I am getting this cleanser at a steal. Compared to other bar soaps I&#8217;ve used in the past as a cleanser, I don&#8217;t feel that they lathered as well or left me feeling as fresh and clean as Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap.Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap also has an amazingly clean fresh scent that you can smell before you even take it out of the box. I love awakening my senses to the smell of Adovia&#8217;s Dead Sea Salt Soap in the morning. It makes me feel like I am doing something good for my skin and feeling good in my skin couldn&#8217;t come at a better price.

I work on my feet and get pedicures about once every couple months and the ladies comment that my feet are really good, not too beat up.  My hands, however....

  AFTER: Dead Sea Salt Soap is a pleasant fragrant traditional soap. The whole bathroom smelled so nice after I put this bar. It was amazing. It left my skin very soft, clean and refreshed even at extremely dried area such as my knees where I needed to used a lots of cream after shower. Dead Sea Salt Soap did an amazing job and it deeply moisturized and hydrated my dry skin. I am really falling in love with this product, especially since it's ingredients are all natural.

  AFTER: I have to mix it with glycerine to give it 'slip'.  When I mix it, I use it on my body---feels too thick and heavy to put on my hair.  I know some 'naturals' love this stuff but, perhaps I have a psychological resistance to just the words 'castor oil'.  And that old smell is still there.  Remember when your grandmother used to make you take it cuz you were plugged up?  Eeeew!Fortunately, no one can make me eat this stuff!  Perhaps if someone would share with me some incredible natural hair or skin recipe I'd incorporate it more into my routine.  But as it currently stands, I'll stick to my glycerine and coconut oil.

  AFTER: Dead Sea Salt has all sorts of minerals, but I was skeptical whether it would really make any difference in a soap. I have only used the soap a couple times so I can't comment on long term skin effects, but I can say the following things:1. The soap is super moisturizing. My skin was so soft after showering.2. It smells really nice (and neutral - my husband can use it without complaining...)3. The bar is solid. Other moisturizing bars disintegrate. This bar is holding up well in the shower.A few of the minerals in the soap are magnesium and potassium - both necessary for healthy skin and muscles. We soak in epsom salts (magnesium) for health so if the body can absorb any of these from the soap, it's probably a good thing.

  AFTER: I am 37 and starting to get those fine laugh lines and "crows feet".  I decided to give this a whirl.  While I like the unscented version better, the scented is still nice and not offensive; I have gotten creams in the past which are just too offensive and give me a headache.  My husband had commented on the earlier creams and for this one he hasn't said a word! (Not to mention the earlier ones did not work though I cannot remember, for the life of me, what they were; obviously I was not impressed.)The scented version has a light, non-offensive odor.  The unscented version has no odor (imagine that).  Regardless, they both do reduce fine lines!I was using it for about a week (8 days maybe?) before I saw a difference.  My fine lines were finer and less noticable.  (Probably no one but I noticed them before I started using this but it made me feel better and that is the point, isn't it?)And, when I got them, the exfoliating face-wash was being sold with it for half off.  And that is also a great product.I recommend this for anyone with light crease lines and who wants to keep their skin rejuvenated! I also highly recommend that you use the Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub Face Wash, as aforementioned.  I will also review that!

  AFTER: I have tried many creams over the years and keep going back to Olay.  But, I have not tried the Micro Sculpting cream until now.It is fantastic.At 56, not only wrinkles but, sagging are big concerns.I've tried the big deal creams from Lancome to Estee Lauder to others.  The results were always so-so and not really satisfying.I have these creepy lines between my mouth and cheeks and they are awful when seen in daylight.  Creams and makeup do not hide these and they are stubborn.  I hate them.Recently lines on the bridge of my nose and  around my eyes - even with using eye creams - are growing as well.And the sagging around the jaw line.Since using the Olay Micro Sculpting I have noticed real improvements in days.  Lines have softened and those creepy ones by my mouth are become less noticable.while I know I'll never look like I did at 30. I just want to look better without alot of lines and sagging.This does it.My skin is much smoother and brighter.  I love the way my skin is looking.I don't feel self conscience now.  I don't feel old.

The first use and my face was NOT dry and scratchy afterwards, my body didnt itch. Again another reason i had to stop barsoaps. Instead it has a great clean smell and my face not only got very clean but my redness has went down, i felt as if i had lotion on my face as it was super smooth feeling. My body feels less dry and so honestly im am stoked to use this as a daily routine. This just might be my new soap of choice. Worth every penny!

The model used in their photoshoot had gorgeous eyelashes, and I'm pleased to see that this mascara really delivers!! You'll get your own runway-worthy eyes with the long, thickly emphasized lashes this product delivers.I've tried a number of other mascara products, and this one is my favorite by far.  I've also got sensitive eyes and skin, and need cosmetics that don't cause an allergic reaction.  This is a gentle formula and I've experienced no flaking, so contact lens wearers don't need to worry.It doesn't smear much even if you have to rub your eyes, and washes off easily at the end of the day.I also enjoy Million Lashes by L'Oreal, but Clump Crusher beats it. The price was a little lower than L'oreal here as well. Try it and love it!

  AFTER: I have tried just about everything- and I mean EVERYTHING (I worked in skincare for several years and was able to try hundreds of products for free)- and this is the one and only thing that 1) made any difference whatsoever on my pitted acne scarring (and a big difference at that)2) kept me from breaking out ONCE regardless of time of month or what I used on my face3) refined large pores and evened tone on my faceI couldn't believe how much it turned my skin around. I had redness, uneven tone, pitted scars and at least five or six blemishes at all times and after day two of using it, I had far less blemishes and less redness. By week two I had less scarring, smaller pores and no blemishes whatsoever. I have to say I've had NO issues with the quality of the product and I've used it every single day for two months. It still rolls just as well as it did the first time and it doesn't snag on skin at all. Works like new for me! The person who had problems with it probably just got a defective one, but neither of the two I've ordered have given me or my husband any problems.

  AFTER: I've seen lots of people talk about JBCO on you tube so I thought I'd give it a try.  This is my second bottle that I've ordered and it does seem to be growing back my edges.  I massage it in every night at bedtime.  I'm going to give this 3 bottles before I can really tell if it's working or not but I believe it is.

  AFTER: I did not use this more than two weeks. I don't really know if it works. It was too oily for my hair. It might be better for someone with really short hair.

  AFTER: I have to mix it with glycerine to give it 'slip'.  When I mix it, I use it on my body---feels too thick and heavy to put on my hair.  I know some 'naturals' love this stuff but, perhaps I have a psychological resistance to just the words 'castor oil'.  And that old smell is still there.  Remember when your grandmother used to make you take it cuz you were plugged up?  Eeeew!Fortunately, no one can make me eat this stuff!  Perhaps if someone would share with me some incredible natural hair or skin recipe I'd incorporate it more into my routine.  But as it currently stands, I'll stick to my glycerine and coconut oil.

  AFTER: I returned this after a week.  I didn't care for the smell and upon closer inspection of the label, found there are chemicals that I am trying to avoid.  It probably works just fine but I found other more natural creams that work and don't include the harsh chemicals. Bel Essence All-Natural Anti-Wrinkle Treatment is the one I tried after this and I'm still using it.

  AFTER: I don't do anything with a hairdryer except dry my hair (meaning I don't use it to "style" my hair).  This hairdryer does dry hair.  It's not as lightweight as you might think (which is why I bought it).  It's really kind of bulky.  Also, the buttons are too easy to push and located right where you hold the thing, so I'm constantly turning the dryer off when I'm using it..... annoying.  I guess I shouldn't complain too much about a product that didn't cost much.

  AFTER: I opened the package in the car and my husband exclaimed, "What is it?  It smells like something my Great Aunt Mildred would wear!"  FYI: He never was a fan of how she smelled.  The good thing is, it smells strong, but it doesn't not smell strong on my face (or hands that I use to lather my face).This can be used as a face and body soap.  I have only used it on my face, and will continue to only use it on my face, as after three days of using it, I have already noticed a difference.  My skin is naturally very dry and breaks out with most products.  I stopped using other products several days before using this so that I would know how the Dead Sea Salt worked.I have noticed the biggest difference in my complexion.  I would recommend this to anyone that has redness or an uneven skin tone.

  AFTER: This is a 4.4 ounce white bar of soap and comes in a neatly designed blue and white box.  It smells great.  But, it's a little on the perfumey side.  This is not a product for the men folk, unless he's walking on heals from a recent pedicure and has his head wrapped up in a floral towel.There are over 26 Dead Sea minerals contained in the bar.  Also present are zinc, bromide, sodium, calcium, magnesium and palm oil.  The soap can be used on a daily basis without drying out your moisture-challenged skin.We love it.  It's just what we needed!

  AFTER: it shipped fast, and was as promised.  i love that it's lightweight and can dry my thick, curly, long hair in about 10 mins (which is about 20 mins faster than my last blow dryer) without causing frizzies (when using the diffuser, which was included, along with a concentrator) or my arms needing a break.  the only time i've had my hair dried faster was at Gene Juarez with what i'm assuming is much more expensive equipment.  for under $30 i can live with the toggle buttons where they are.  i turned it off once by accident, and just repositioned my hand after that and it was not an issue.

  AFTER: I used this with vitamin e cream for a better observation. After a few weeks of using this i get dark hypermentation on my for heads. I wouldn't recommend this harsh product.

  AFTER: This is my favorite mascara of all time and, coming from a middle schooler obsessed with makeup, I've tried a looot of mascaras. If you are looking for length, this will give you length. Even if your lashes are short and stubby, this mascara will make your lashes look long and luscious. It doesn't do much for volume though so if you are looking to thicken your lashes this isn't that mascara for you. Although I would recommend the NYX doll eye volume waterproof mascara.

  AFTER: The first time I opened the tube (mind you, it was sealed), the mascara looked like it had already been used - there were little hairs! But upon closer inspection and some research, those &#34;little hairs&#34; are actually fibers incorporated in the formula that make your lashes look longer.It really does do the trick as I got so many compliments on how long my lashes looked. It was easy to apply, didn't clump or smear, and didn't irritate my eyes.

  AFTER: I tried this a 2nd time on a friend's recommendation. If used OVER my Rosacea-treatment cream it's great.After a few months it actually seems to have decreased some fine lines. At first I thought I could replace Finacea (Rosacea Rx cream), but that's when I got into trouble...when I didn't use Finacea first.If used AFTER Finacea which really dries out the skin, especially around eyes and mouth...when used after (on top of settled Finacea), it makes my skin feel less tight and apparently has eased some fine lines...unreal!Retinol is murder on Rosacea-skin and most "wonder" products have retinol. This does not have retinol...TG!

I am 63 and at this age I know how important a moisturizer is.  I use it on my brow and jawline and around my eyelids and mouth.  I really like this cream, and I have tried more expensive creams which are not as good as this!  Give this a try, and see for yourself the creamy smooth results!

  AFTER: Okay ... At first I was thinking, &#34;Yay! Free soap.&#34; I have a slight addiction to soaps and things that smell good.THEN IT ARRIVED IN THE MAIL.I honestly do not think after trying this that I will buy anything else.First the smell, because I always start with the smell. It smells AMAZING. There isn't one bad thing to say about the smell. I think I huffed the box a good five or six times getting myself excited for bath time.Second. You know how most soaps after you rinse them off, your skin feel rough? Your fingers don't slide over smooth, its a bumpy ride. This stuff. NOT THE CASE! I swear I feel like a baby. Well my skin does. It is really soft. So the moisturizing capabilities of this stuff is awesome. I normally use dove, because its soft too. But this stuff blows my normal brand right out of the water.Third. Seems to have a slight healing capability too. I had broken out really bad after trying a lotion with too much perfume. my skin reacted so badly to it, that I had little red bumps &#34;Which naturally I had picked at and irritated farther.&#34; ONE USE and they were almost gone. Two days ... they were finished. So I am thinking that if I had a really bad break out on my face &#34;Which I don't know if its true because thanks to vitamin c serums I haven't have that issue.&#34; But my assumption is that it would work on clearing that up quite well too. IF YOU GUYS TRY IT, and you do have a problem with acne. Please let me know. &#34;I am curious.&#34;All in all this stuff ROCKS! I don't like the price tag off 11 dollars a bar ... but I love what it does for my skin, so I will be looking past that. I truthfully LOVE this soap.Thanks for stopping by xxDee

  AFTER: I have been looking for a better mascara than I usually use (Maybelline Volum' Express Falsies). I gave this one a try and wasn't that impressed. It feels like hardly any mascara actually gets on your eye lashes so it looks very light. It's easy to take off and I haven't noticed any running but I am looking for a much more obvious looking mascara so this didn't quite cut it.

  AFTER: I ordered this product with the hope that it could help with a few white stretch marks on my hips. Note that I have had these marks since I was 13 years old and I am now 29 so the thought of finally minimizing them was worth the try. I did alot of research before I started and followed it religiously giving my skin enough time to heal and benefit from the rolls.I followed the rolling with a natural mixture of shea butter and coconut oil. Though the whole process is a little painful, its bearable and women go through much worse with waxing etc.Unlike others, I did not roll to the point of bleeding. Also ensure that you sanitize and store the product properly between uses.Its not a miracle product but after a few weeks I noticed that the stretch marked skin was smooth and you could no longer feel the indents from the mark itself ( they were still visible).This to me was the most improvement I have ever had in them having tried several creams and scrubs before. My problem with this product is that the needles go dull too quickly. I have ordered two times and both had to be discarded after a few uses. I really wish it was more durable.I will try this type of product again but maybe from a different brand.

  AFTER: Sometimes I skip foundation, sometimes I skip eye shadow... I NEVER skip the mascara. It's the one item of make up I truly care about wearing. (Well, that and lip gloss. Anyway...)This mascara is amazing. Though I haven't tested it in the rain- I CAN say that it is long lasting. I worked a 14 hour day and was too exhausted to take off my make up before hitting the sack, when I woke up in the morning my mascara still looked great. I haven't tested it in the rain yet, buttt it comes off very easily with some generic make up remover I have. (The easier it comes off, the better, for me.)This mascara does not clump. I love it. My eyelashes look long and silky- they don't look like gross spider legs with this stuff. No flakes, no smudges. Highly recommend this one!

  AFTER: I stumbled across this item in a search for something else.  I decided to read up on it. Then I decided to try it.  I don't know if I can get past the pain of it.  I am not sure how hard I should be pressing, however, it is painful and the instructions say to go in a pattern that goes basically in every direction,  There is also discomfort afterwords a slight burning and then the next day itching. Not sure if I will get any results.  I just did a chemical peel a few weeks ago and now will use this again will update as I time goes on.

  AFTER: The color is a true Coral color.I have purchased several IBD Polishes on Amazon and really like the Brand.  The price is fantastic (Around $7 w/ shipping) and it last a good 10 days with no chips before it starts lifting.  This is pretty typical length for Gel polishes on me and I am very happy with that time frame.You need an LED or UV light and you cure for 30 seconds.  You also need a PH bond, Foundation/Base and a Topcoat to cure in the Light as well.

I am  impressed!!! so if your looking for something that will help firm and minimize wrinkles and not harsh on the skin and easy to find ...this is it!!I gave it a 4 rating because I do not care for the heavy container and the lid...but product inside is really good!

  AFTER: I have tried just about everything- and I mean EVERYTHING (I worked in skincare for several years and was able to try hundreds of products for free)- and this is the one and only thing that 1) made any difference whatsoever on my pitted acne scarring (and a big difference at that)2) kept me from breaking out ONCE regardless of time of month or what I used on my face3) refined large pores and evened tone on my faceI couldn't believe how much it turned my skin around. I had redness, uneven tone, pitted scars and at least five or six blemishes at all times and after day two of using it, I had far less blemishes and less redness. By week two I had less scarring, smaller pores and no blemishes whatsoever. I have to say I've had NO issues with the quality of the product and I've used it every single day for two months. It still rolls just as well as it did the first time and it doesn't snag on skin at all. Works like new for me! The person who had problems with it probably just got a defective one, but neither of the two I've ordered have given me or my husband any problems.

  AFTER: I used to have really dry ends although I cut my hair about a 2 months from using this product. I researched the reason and the only reason I could find was that my hair was not very strong and I needed something like a hair reconstructor. I bought this product since I usually like going natural. I missed 1 teaspoon of honey with 1 teaspoon of coconut oil with 1 teaspoon of this castor oil, microwaved it until it all melted together and put that all over my hair. I left that it for about an hour and there is already a visible difference. The ends of my hair are no longer dry. I have used coconut oil with honey before but the affect of 2 together is nothing like the 3 together. Lots of the reviews were talking about it being too thick and unusable the solution to that is warming it up in the microwave for a few seconds.

  AFTER: I give this 5 stars due to the things I consider extremely important in a gel polish.#1 is opacity. This polish took 2 coats to be opaque. That's wonderful!#2 is application. This polish applied wonderfully. Not streaky or too runny. Didn't pool in the cuticle area.#3 is shrink back. This polish has ZERO shrink back. As long as you cap the free edge as usual, there's no shrinking issues.#4 is price. You can't beat the price of IBD Just Gel polishes. They are all very reasonably priced.#5 is lasting power. This polish lasted 2 weeks and 4 days, zero chipping, cracking or peeling. Its looked flawless for the entire manicure.Black lava will now be my go to black gel Polish. Its simply black, no shimmer or frost. Its better than some of the expensive black gels I've tried and lasts way longer and applies better. Also the brush is in my opinion one of the best. Not too big, not too small. Doesn't make a mess of my cuticles :)

  AFTER: This is a very good hair dryer. It's Ionic/Tourmaline/Ceramic which is supposed to be easy on hair and minimize frizz. My hair is coarse and kinky and after drying it's smooth, frizz & static free. I use it to dry my hair and then use a flat iron, so I haven't used the diffuser and concentrator attachments. The dryer has Hot/warm, low/high settings and a cool shot. In my opinion, it's relatively quiet. It also has a vent on the back that you have to clean out, which is a new feature than what I'm used to. It's a good thing because a strand of my hair got sucked into the back of the last one (what do you even do about that?) The directions are stated very clear and tell you how to take care of your hair dryer. Revlon is a great trusted brand, and for $16 this is fantastic. Highly recommend.

It left my skin very soft, clean and refreshed even at extremely dried area such as my knees where I needed to used a lots of cream after shower. Dead Sea Salt Soap did an amazing job and it deeply moisturized and hydrated my dry skin. I am really falling in love with this product, especially since it's ingredients are all natural.

  AFTER: Nowadays there are all sorts of skin care products and services that offer making one's skin feel better and look younger.  I came across this product by accident.  Unlike many high tech solutions (LED light, micrtocurrent, lasers) this is mechanical device with little needles that one can roll arond the face (my device's needles are 1 mm long).I was thrilled when I received this product.  It is small and very handy to use.  Needles are very small but very sharp.  Despite their sharpness, they will not hurt your skin, device will invirogate the top layer of the skin and one will feel tinkling on the parts that roller was used on.  I typically use this roller in the evening.  After I remove makeup, exfoliate skin, clean it with cleanser and tone, I use roller for a few minutes on my chin, cheeks and forehead.  I finish up by applying eye cream, face serum and night cream for face and neck.  It is still early for me to say if there are any significant results, but for now I just like the tingling effect that tool creates.  This tool comes in a handly little plastic container.  I wish there are better instructions on the box how to keep this tool desinfected after certain number of uses.  I guess, I will just emerse it in alchohol for a while and continue to use it in a manner I am using it now.

  AFTER: Ive been meaning to order this for months. Its the best for regrowing edges. It came on time in a cute bottle. I only use a bit on each temple so it should last at least 2 months. It has a smoky smell that i found kind of strange at first but it ok now and it the thickness of syrup which i kinda like since my hair is thick as well. Its the thickest oil Ive ever used. It moisturises my edges very well especially since its thick. I has new growth already

  AFTER: ok, there is limited clumpiness, but I still found myself pulling out my handy dandy lash separating tool, which is fine, i don't mind the extra effort but I did not find any Wow factor with this mascara. Personally I think the LashBlast Volume (orange tube) is much more clump crushing, I NEVER have clumps or any lashes sticking together even after applying layer on top of layer, and it fans it out perfectly enough where I don't even need my separating tool. This one is ok, but when this runs out im sticking with last blast volume.

  AFTER: This soap smells nice and soaps up well.  It does not clog my pores or dry out my skin either.  My only complaint is that it does not moisturize as well as a body wash.  The soap, as with all bar soaps I have used, leaves a tight, almost draggy feeling on my skin.  Therefore, I would pick a body wash over the bar soap formula.

  AFTER: By comparable, I mean they both don't clump, they both elongate and thicken, and they both have the same hard bristles. Granted, Benefit's product has more body, but the same can be achieved with Covergirl's mascara after a few applications.

  AFTER: While somewhat moisturizing, it did nothing to firm my skin. I used it nightly, after washing my face, toning, then using the serum in the same line. After a month, there was no difference. I switched to organic sweet almond oil, and saw more results from it in just three days. I have just ordered frankincense essential oil, as well as an immortelle blend that I plan to add to the SAO. I've heard of much better results going this route than to keep using these supposed miracle creams. I gave it three stars only because it did provide some moisture and didn't break me out as much as some products have. The shipping time was adequate.

  AFTER: This is a good cream if you have sensitive or combination skin....or dry skin. if it is oily all over...it will be too heavy for you. not for teens or early twenties... its good for more mature skin and you will love how your skin will stay moist for a long period of time.....I use it all over my face even around my eyes and I normally can not do this with just any face product cause it will sting and burn my eyes.....not this one! I am  impressed!!! so if your looking for something that will help firm and minimize wrinkles and not harsh on the skin and easy to find ...this is it!!I gave it a 4 rating because I do not care for the heavy container and the lid...but product inside is really good!

  AFTER: My wife has used this for years. It is easy to apply, and despite the small size of the jar, it lasts a while because only a very small amount is necessary to apply at a time. My wife has found this very effective for dealing with wrinkles on her face and says it works great.From time to time this is on sale at my local Costco for less than the price on Amazon.

  AFTER: I tried this as well as the regular castor oil, I love them both but would probably prefer this one over the other one. This one cost a couple of dollars more but it works better in my opinion. I have natural hair and my edges were thinning from a hairstyle that I had that was too tight, this grew my edges back almost completely in 45 days, I could see some growth after 2 days. I also put this on my eyebrows for fullness and have friends that rub a little on their eyelashes. I had no problems with shedding like I have read in other reviews. This is my 3 bottle that I have ordered. The only slight problem I had was a small amount of leakage when shipped.

  AFTER: This hair dryer is the third in a series of attempts to find the right hair dryer for my wife, who has long thick hair.  The first one was a Vidal Sassoon that had ionic technology, but didn't get near hot enough.  She was drying her hair for > 20 minutes.The second attempt was the Revlon RV469 ceramic, which was much quieter and got hotter, but didn't have much air flow.  Also, it is quite heavy.  It was better than the first dryer, but not hair drying nirvana.This dryer (Revlon RV544) has easily cut my wife's drying time in half.  She has very thick & long hair, and the high heat setting makes quick work of it.  It gets hot enough that I actually tone it down to warm for myself (I have short, thick hair) whenever I have to use the dryer.  I think the air flow settings are perfect.  The dryer is also nice and light, and fits in a bathroom drawer easily, unlike some of the bulkier models out there.My wife thinks this is the best dryer she has ever had.  We highly recommend it.

  AFTER: I like this product combine with an anti wrinkle cream it works well or with the anti wrinkle patch. Ok, this product you must be careful with to much pressure on the eye area will hurt.  So roll lightly.  It is like a little meat tenderizer that allows the cream, lotions, serum etc., to penetrate theskin so you will get faster results.  I liked it but stopped using it after a week, so I only gave it three stars.  But now that i am writing this review i will start using it again tonight.  Happy rolling!

  AFTER: Castor oil...the ultimate in skin and hair moisture. I mix it with almond oil for my elbows, knees, and feet (the roughest parts on my body). Works like a charm. I use it alone for the rest of my body (including my face at night). The results? Soft, kissable skin and strong, shiny hair. Love this stuff!!!!

  AFTER: After one use on my acne scars they're 75% better. I use it with lavender oil for pain reduction and skin/scar repair. I use it on my stretch marks and they are better after only two uses. However, this is tramendously painful on non fatty tissues. But before too long--as with epilating--the endorphins kick in and the pain seems to magically fade away. I can here the needles sinking into my facial skin &#34;pop pop&#34;. I can see the blood spots after too. I use it at night to make good use of the nocturnal healing process.

  AFTER: Dead Sea Salt soap sounded to me like it would be coarse (like most exfoliating soaps) but it wasn&#8217;t at all!  It has a very clean, fresh scent to it that stays with me throughout the day.  There is no &#8220;perfumey&#8221; smell that is overwhelming like I&#8217;ve found with some soaps.  It leaves my skin feeling soft and looking smooth.  I love this soap!  I have used it on my babies and it has worked well with no issues.  I would definitely recommend this soap to anyone.

  AFTER: I've tried hoards of mascaras. This wears very well for morning to late afternoon. It will get you through a work day. And it doesn't run or bleed, so that's a great perk. But by evening, it flakes a little bit. Comes off easily with remover; doesn't require a waterproof remover or anything. It's very black, which I like. But the appicator is a little skimpy. I like fullness, so it's not my favorite. If you like separated lashes, this will be a good wand for you. It's also nice and long, which I like. Overall, a pretty good product.

  AFTER: For a long time, I have been using Lubiderm with SPF on my hands and chest.  I don't like to use my expensive skin products on these areas because the costs add up quickly.The problem with Lubriderm is that it contains fragrance.  I was hoping this Aveeno would be even more gentle and mild, since it doesn't contain perfume.  Not so.  For 3 days in a row, I wore this on my chest and hands and suffered horrible watery eyes and runny nose.  I'm not sure quite what to do.  I might just have to use face products on my chest and hands.  How frustrating.

  AFTER: This oil has a thick sticky consistency. It has almost no smell. There's a faint scent that is sort of waxy... sort of reminds me of how unscented face products and lipsticks smell. It doesn't smell like any kind of foody oil though...the scent isn't gross in my opinion. It's great for hair too, but I think it's amazing on skin. Helps with softening up underye bags.

  AFTER: I purchased this from a seller that offers free shipping and the price was something like under $7. Considering that this price is about what I pay at Target or some other similar store, I think it's reasonable. The brush shape is different than any of mine and it works well because it gets those lashes on the inner and outer aspects at the same time you are applying the center. The consistency is dry but this is not a bad thing, it doesn't tend to form big clumps on the brush or your lashes, and you should apply coats in succession as if you are brushing your lashes as this works best. The other thing I love is that it does not give me raccoon eyes thought it washes off completely with soap and water! I have used a lot of mascaras, the worst was Falsies, which was like pure goop. The best "base" mascara is Great Lash because it's very thin and sort of separates lashes for another mascara but alone is not enough for me. So I typically use Maybelline's Soft and something but they are back on the animal testing list. I find that this works close enough and it doesn't have the drawbacks mentioned. I don't have to use my Elf eye make-up pen to remove smeary mascara half-way through work.

  AFTER: I bought this item on April 18, 2013 and started using it immediately on fine lines on my face and a selected amount of stretch marks on my stomach.  A little over 6 weeks later, I'm writing a review to report my experience.LOVE!I mainly wanted to get rid of the "11"'s between my eyes.  I won't inject poison into my face so this was the next best option.  Many people report that it didn't work for them but I am reporting that it worked for me!  Are they gone?  No, that wouldn't be possible.  Those are muscles that have been trained over more than 3 decades of repeated facial movements.  In my case, I squinted a lot.  But....they DO look A LOT better.  They are not nearly as deep or noticeable.  I am very fair skinned, red hair, freckles so any blemish on my skin is obvious (to me anyway).Another area I tried was a small acne scar.  It is completely gone now.  It used to be a small dent in my face, sort of like a dimple.  There was a white "thing" in it that I would pick at.  It's gone too!The fine lines around my eyes are noticeably gone - seriously, I look like I am 5 years younger in that area. The lines around my mouth (nasolabial folds) are noticeably less pronounced.  This particular device isn't really suited to handle the lines around my lips.I had a brown spot on my cheek, it's completely gone now.  All over, my face looks brighter, smoother and my skin hasn't looked better in years.I have noticed a slight improvement in the test stretch marks, but mostly because I wasn't too diligent with them.My process was:  wash my face with gentle cleanser and rinse with warm water.  I would roll in an asterisk shape (*) on the target area, up and down (or back/forth)about four times each.  I would follow with a good moisturizer - I used basicLubriderm Daily Moisture Lotion SPF 15 Moisturizer with Sunscreen, 13.5  Ouncemost often, but also usedHydroxatone Intensive Anti-Wrinkle Complex,Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum, Fragrance Free, 1.7-Fluid OuncesandAINHOA Whitess Caviar Renewal Serum, 1.05 Fluid Ounce.  Honestly, I think any good moisturizer works fine, whatever works for your skin.  It doesn't need to be expensive.  Pure coconut oil works great too!!Does it hurt?  No, not really.  It feels like you have a light sunburn for about 45 minutes after use.  During use, it didn't feel bad to me - on a scale of 1-10, 1 being no pain and 10 being the worst, I'd say a 2.  No more painful than plucking eyebrows.  I used it about once, maybe twice a week.  I cleaned it by running super hot water on it and splashing some rubbing alcohol on it before putting it away.  I always washed my face immediately before use.  I never had any rashes, breakouts or any other negative response.I didn't tell my husband that I was using what amounts to a rolling pin with needles in it on my face - he thinks I'm kooky enough already.  Besides, I wanted to see if he would notice a difference and he DID.  He asked if I had been drinking more water or using something different on my face because I look YOUNGER.  And no, he wasn't just flattering me, he was being totally honest, I promise.My final thoughts:  This worked for me, inexpensive, was low maintenance, easy to use and no poison injected in my skin.

  AFTER: When I take my shower I like to use some kind of shower soap gel with a soft bath scrubber loofah. I am not usually a big fan of bar soap. Reading about the ADOVIA Dead Sea Salt Soap and all the advantages it has brought up my curiosity, so I thought I would give it a try. The product uses all natural products and has 21 minerals that are key to health and beauty. That caught my attention.I had little idea how great this product would turn out to be. I was pleasantly surprised! I expected it to be gritty and exfoliating just from the words &#34;dead sea salt.&#34;  It was not at all. The mild scent of the soap was so refreshing. It lathered so nicely on my loofah sponge. I have not tried it on my face, however I am using it as a skin-healthy shave soap for my legs.Unlike any other bar soap that I have used, I really like the way it leaves my skin feeling and its ability to lather and rinse off. ADOVIA Dead Sea Salt Soap you are my new product in our shower. I really was impressed!

  AFTER: I love love love this dryer! I have blond, overprocessed, long, fine hair and this dryer leaves it so smooth! I can't believe it! It dries my hair in five minutes, compared to twenty minutes with my old dragon dryer (you know the one, practically spits fire and weighs a ton!).  This does blow fast, even on low, but that is the great thing about it! The dryer is so LIGHT! 14.8 ounces to be exact! I just can't tell you enough about why I love it! The shipping was free, and the price was half what it is in the store.  If you have fragile hair, this is for you. If you have thick hair, this is for you. If you have frizzy hair, fine hair, any hair.. well you get the idea!

  AFTER: I've had this dryer for about two years, and it held up pretty well during that time.  Recently, it started making a burning smell, and regular cleaning of the lint area hasn't helped, so I figured it was time to replace the unit.I originally bought this Revlon unit here on Amazon since it was rated as a Consumer Digest Best Buy, and it's a decent dryer for the price.  If you have shorter hair that is not too thick, this dryer should be fine.That being said, instead of buying a new one of these to replace my old one, I decided to upgrade to a Sedu brand dryer -- and the difference between the two is amazing.  With this Revlon dryer, it took me at least a good 15 minutes to fully dry my short, thick hair.  The Sedu dryer dries my hair in less than five minutes.If you want a good, mid-priced dryer, than this Revlon works well and will last a long time.  However, if you want a faster drying time, I wouldn't recommend this one.  I didn't know how slow this thing was until I splurged on a more expensive unit.Overall, I would give this Revlon unit 3 1/2 stars.

  AFTER: I really like the IBD products because they are good quality, great price, and the bottles are much larger than their more expensive counterparts.But after using this basecoat, my daughter and I both discovered that the polish started peeling off after about 5 days.  My daughter used it first and I thought she just had "oily nails", but when I finally used it, the same thing happened.  The top coat and polish are okay because I'd used them many times; it's just the basecoat.

  AFTER: This bar soap is very moisturizing and lathers up really nicely. It's perfect for anyone with dry or normal/dry skin, since it hydrates so well. The bar itself is a nice thick size - bigger than most other bar soaps I have used - so it will last quite awhile. I'm usually not a fan of bar soaps since they tend to leave my skin dry, but this soap is as moisturizing and sudsy as a body wash cream. And the best part is that it contains natural ingredients from the earth.At first I was just using the soap on my body in the shower, until I realized I should be using it on my face too, as the directions state. I always get kind of nervous when trying new cleansers on my face and I've never tried a facial bar soap before, but man, this one really impressed me! I have sensitive skin and didn't have any irritation or redness, like I usually do after washing my face. I could feel all the dry skin being washed away, and it looks like it helped clear out my pores as well. This soap rinsed away easily and left my face feeling super clean and soft. I'm so excited to finally have a soap that doesn't leave my face red after using it! It's gentle and moisturizing, which is exactly what I need.

  AFTER: I bought Cover Girl Clump Crusher mascara last week, after seeing a recommendation in "Vogue" magazine.  The model used in their photoshoot had gorgeous eyelashes, and I'm pleased to see that this mascara really delivers!! You'll get your own runway-worthy eyes with the long, thickly emphasized lashes this product delivers.I've tried a number of other mascara products, and this one is my favorite by far.  I've also got sensitive eyes and skin, and need cosmetics that don't cause an allergic reaction.  This is a gentle formula and I've experienced no flaking, so contact lens wearers don't need to worry.It doesn't smear much even if you have to rub your eyes, and washes off easily at the end of the day.I also enjoy Million Lashes by L'Oreal, but Clump Crusher beats it. The price was a little lower than L'oreal here as well. Try it and love it!

But it certainly works, I suppose.  Keep in mind, this product is NOT painless, but bearable.

  AFTER: The Mineral soap arrived in great condition, in a cute little box.  It is about the size of a regular bar of soap.  My mom was here the day it came, and she said that it smells like ivory.  I thought it just had a strong, soap smell.  I know, imagine that, the soap smells like soap :-).  There is no perfume or fruity like smells, (which, really is to be expected from an all natural soap) and it was very strong. However,  During a shower, the smell is not that strong, and I really like how it smells on your skin.My husband is a carpenter, so he is around dust, dirt, and is sweating for a good part of his day.  I thought he would benefit from this the most. It has been a few days now, and I can feel a difference in my skin, as well as see a difference in my husbands.  His pores on his face and back do not look as clogged and yucky like they usually do,  he scrubs them twice daily, before the new Mineral Soap, and now, with it.  The new soap has clearly made a difference!  You can feel a tightening in the skin almost immediately, before even getting out of the shower. Soap DOES lather on a wash cloth! The bar seems to be lasting a decent amount of time. We have used it quite a bit and there is plenty left! I would most definitely buy this soap in the future, as well as recommend to everyone!

  AFTER: This soap fit easily into the palm of my hand and glides over my skin creating a light, clean, fragrant lather.  It rinses off easily and left my skin with a delightful, healthy glow.Usually after showering I must apply some type of body lotion to my skin to avoid the chalky, ashy look of dry skin.  I didn't apply any lotion after using this soap to test it's hydrating ability.  I was pleasantly surprised that my skin continued to look bright and healthy for over 8 hours.  For me this is Huge.  If there is a way to shave a few minutes off my morning routine, I'm all for it.  I will be purchasing this soap over and over again.

  AFTER: Yep, that's what it does - dries hair. It's not horrible (especially for the price), but there's nothing special about it either. Pay no attention to the claim that it makes your hair shinier, because it doesn't. It didn't add volume, either. However, when I purchased this, I didn't expect either of the claims to hold up - I bought it to dry my hair, and it did...I purchased this in 2010, and had to toss it in the middle of 2013 because the cord started sparking when I plugged it in. I like hair dryers that get hot, but not *that* hot... so in the trash it went. That said, lasting 2 1/2 years at the price I paid is okay with me.

  AFTER: I was contacted to try and review this soap, and I jumped on the opportunity.  I've used Adovia products in the past, and was always so happy with the results.When I received this soap in  the mail, and opened it up, I found myself wanting to try it immediately.  The scent of this soap is just wonderful.  I love walking into my bathroom, and getting a whiff of the soap.  It's such a clean, spring-like scent.After using it for about 2 weeks, I noticed a big change with my skin.  So far, I've only used it on my face. It has left my face feeling super soft and help tremendously with my combination skin.  I struggle with dry skin around my nose and cheeks. This bar has really helped clear that issue up.Anyone who is looking to brighten up their complexion should give this soap a try.  I have noticed not only a brighter complexion, but a smoother complexion.  It's my new favorite facial cleanser.Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.

  AFTER: I like this product combine with an anti wrinkle cream it works well or with the anti wrinkle patch. Ok, this product you must be careful with to much pressure on the eye area will hurt.  So roll lightly.  It is like a little meat tenderizer that allows the cream, lotions, serum etc., to penetrate theskin so you will get faster results.  I liked it but stopped using it after a week, so I only gave it three stars.  But now that i am writing this review i will start using it again tonight.  Happy rolling!

  AFTER: I've been obsessed with my DIY gel nail kit that I got for my birthday and have already accumulated five colors (two Sephora by OPI, one Sally Hansen, and two IBD). To be honest, I prefer the formulation of IBD the best. I find that I have to do three coats (as opposed to two coats with the OPI and Sally Hansen). In terms of removal, I'd say they're all pretty much the same...As for the color itself (Sparkling Embers), I'd say it's a pale rosy gold - almost like champagne! Although there's definitely glitter, the color is subtle enough for me to wear to work (and I work in a pretty conservative commercial real estate office). The thin formulation allows you to pick exactly how much color you want on your nails (rather than just glombing it on all at once).When I first purchased this product, the shipping calculation said seven business days, but it was actually delivered exactly a week after I ordered it. As a long time Prime member, I'm used to the (almost) instant gratification of two-day shipping, but this was definitely worth the wait!

  AFTER: I have to say I do so love Adovia product and this one is very nice. I love they way it smells and cleans. I love to use this with my Clarisonic because it distributes more evenly than a liquid or cream soap, All I do is dampen the brush dead and than turn it on the bar so it picks up the right amount of product evenly. This face/body bar is very moisturizing and natural with dead sea minerals , its very easy to work with and nose a excellent job of cleaning. The company sent me a free sample to try so I could make an informed review but my opinions are my own . Try is and see if you dont agree

  AFTER: I love this soap and I love the scent.  One thing I look for in a soap is that it doesn't leave your skin feeling dry afterwards. This salt leaves my skin feeling moisturized, smelling great and the dead sea salt works as a good skin cleanser.  I would reccomend using this soap with the salts for an even better effect!

  AFTER: I love nude colors I have a gelish nude that is extremely runny, I was hoping this would be better but unfortunately is not.  Not as runny but pretty sheer even with 3 coats. Love this brand and it arrived fast but I won't purchase this color again.

  AFTER: I've become a big fan of Adovia products. This soap bar is another great addition to their line of products. I love this soap bar! It is a solid smooth bar that is a decent size and has lasted me for over a week now. It doesn't leave any weird film or residue on my skin. It actually moistures my skin and makes it feel so smooth! It makes me feel clean after without drying out my skin. It does have a very light nice scent to it that is not overwhelming in any way. It lathers well.  On top of all of that, it's infused with 100% dead sea salts which benefits your skin. Makes me feel so luxurious using it. I would highly recommend!

  AFTER: It doesn't clump...like the name, but it also doesn't give me the length I'm looking for.  I'm not sure why, but several times when using this item, I've ended up poking myself in the eye with it too.  I think it's the shape of the wand.  It's not awful...just not great.  I am using it in my &#34;travel&#34; makeup bag now.

  AFTER: This is GREAT mascara, it is just as described. It gives you Doll Eyes if you put on multiple coats waiting 30 seconds in between each layer for them to dry. It has no clumps, but make sure to clean off the end when using it. It is really a nice quality product. One of my favorite mascaras.

UID: 23101
  BEFORE: <none>
  AFTER: This mascara is okay. As it claims, it adds volume and a little length without clumping. The biggest drawback, however, is that it starts flaking after a couple of hours, leaving a residue under my lower lashes. I usually use Covergirl's "professional" mascara, and although I don't think it provides quite as much volume as this one does, it doesn't flake or smear, no matter how long I wear it. Every other mascara I've tried does one or the other. This one didn't smear, but flaking was an issue.

  AFTER: I feel I shouldnt review right now, until I see results.But I just love this Castor Oil.I recently did a hot oil treatment with this and olive oil.And after I sat under the dryer, and washed it out,My hair was so soft and shiny....I just want my hair to grow back to what it was.......

UID: 23103

  AFTER: I tried this a 2nd time on a friend's recommendation. If used OVER my Rosacea-treatment cream it's great.After a few months it actually seems to have decreased some fine lines. At first I thought I could replace Finacea (Rosacea Rx cream), but that's when I got into trouble...when I didn't use Finacea first.If used AFTER Finacea which really dries out the skin, especially around eyes and mouth...when used after (on top of settled Finacea), it makes my skin feel less tight and apparently has eased some fine lines...unreal!Retinol is murder on Rosacea-skin and most "wonder" products have retinol. This does not have retinol...TG!

  AFTER: so first off, remember folks, the medical use for consumption of castor oil is for laxative effects! which it does quite effectively, considering other poster's commentary.  For beauty purposes, its a one size fits all miracle.  massage your scalp (try to avoid hair) for hairloss, or just general hair health and length encouragement, spread a bit on tips of hair for fly-away control and frizzie help. For calluses, massage in, cover with sock/glove and wait overnight, for acne scars, stretchmarks, pock-marks, scars and miscellaneous bumps and bruises, a bit of this applied helps clear most skin issues in relatively low timeframe.  I give it 4/5 stars because it has little smell, and a nice smell would be way nicer as well as an oil which is less viscous.  As it is, castor oil is relatively thick.If your wondering if this will 'work for you', then my experience says yes, since castor oil is so versatile!

  AFTER: I absolutely love this mascara. I love the shape of the brush, it makes it easy to get to the base of my lashes, which I need because of my very blonde eyelashes. It doesn't clump up on me, and the brush is the perfect size. It makes my lashes look great! I've tried a lot of mascara brands with a lot of different formulas and brush shapes. This is definitely in my top 5 favorites!

UID: 23106
  BEFORE: <none>
  AFTER: I have blonde sparse lashes that aren't very long. I need a mascara brush that is fine with bristles that aren't too long or the mascara between the bristles never makes to my lashes. This brush does that on the end bristles but then gets a little fat for me. The mascara itself is a good consistency, not too thick nor too thin. I may look for other Cover Girl mascara's with a bit smaller brush.

  AFTER: This bar soap is very moisturizing and lathers up really nicely. It's perfect for anyone with dry or normal/dry skin, since it hydrates so well. The bar itself is a nice thick size - bigger than most other bar soaps I have used - so it will last quite awhile. I'm usually not a fan of bar soaps since they tend to leave my skin dry, but this soap is as moisturizing and sudsy as a body wash cream. And the best part is that it contains natural ingredients from the earth.At first I was just using the soap on my body in the shower, until I realized I should be using it on my face too, as the directions state. I always get kind of nervous when trying new cleansers on my face and I've never tried a facial bar soap before, but man, this one really impressed me! I have sensitive skin and didn't have any irritation or redness, like I usually do after washing my face. I could feel all the dry skin being washed away, and it looks like it helped clear out my pores as well. This soap rinsed away easily and left my face feeling super clean and soft. I'm so excited to finally have a soap that doesn't leave my face red after using it! It's gentle and moisturizing, which is exactly what I need.

UID: 23109

  AFTER: it shipped fast, and was as promised.  i love that it's lightweight and can dry my thick, curly, long hair in about 10 mins (which is about 20 mins faster than my last blow dryer) without causing frizzies (when using the diffuser, which was included, along with a concentrator) or my arms needing a break.  the only time i've had my hair dried faster was at Gene Juarez with what i'm assuming is much more expensive equipment.  for under $30 i can live with the toggle buttons where they are.  i turned it off once by accident, and just repositioned my hand after that and it was not an issue.

  AFTER: FUNNY BONE is a nice color, not too great against my medium/light skin tone, but i'll still wear it from time to time. reminds me of bubblegum or barbie pink. not too bright. I've found it helpul to google &#34;IBD POLISH IMAGES&#34; to view the images on a person or swatch. no shimmer or glitter.COSMETICS CENTRAL AND SALON SUPPLY STORE ARE GREAT SELLERS.

  AFTER: My face felt a little red and irritated for the first week I used this. I even had a couple of minor breakouts.I stuck with it, like I read on a beauty website, and I'm happy I did.My face is smoother. The sensitivity is gone and I'm not experiencing any more breakouts.I think my skin had to cycle through and turnover old cells (and purge itself of oil and debris)Once that was done, it looks great. Honestly one of the best OTC creams I've used. I also use Retin-a (for wrinkle prevention) and find this to be a great night cream on the days I don't use the Retin-a.

  AFTER: This is going to be one of those reviews where you wonder "does this person work for the company selling this product??" but I can assure you I don't have anything to do with them... I just love their moisturizer.  I have been using this for several months after purchasing it at a local big box store.  I have found other moisturizers to either be too greasy (leaving me with a shiny face) or too scented or too thin.  Some of them haven't "rubbed in" well and I find I have little white spots on my face later.This, to me, is the perfect moisturizer.  It has just a faint faint faint smell of something (Oatmeal?) very nice.  Just a little whiff that is one part Elmer's glue and 10 parts water and 10 parts oatmeal.  I know that doesn't sound that appealing but trust me, it's a nice scent.  It rubs in right away and leaves your face feeling really refreshed.  I fly a lot for work and often use this in the morning before a long flight.  I'm surprised well into a long (14 hour) flight how moist my face still feels.  So it lasts.You can read my other reviews and see I don't give out 5 stars very often...but I really like this product and highly recommend it.  I just ordered the same moisturizer with 15 SPF which sounds like an improvement on an already perfect moisturizer.

  AFTER: I started using this recently and really like how my skin feels clean but not tight or dry. I have been using it morning and again in the evening. I put on my usual moisturizers and makeup during the day and at night I use it to clean my face of all the makeup and then I use my moisturizers.  My skin looks and feels good.  I love that it is 100% all natural too..there are no weird ingredients.  I was noticing a little flaking and dry skin prior to starting with the soap but after I started using the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Soap it seemed to stop. My skin has been looking really nice and it feels comfortable, not tight or dry.

  AFTER: I think this is a good, basic moisturizer. Not a fan of the cloying floral smell, or the jar.  Would prefer a pump, so the germs from fingers don't get mixed in my face cream. Claims of micro-sculpting properties may be exaggerated!

  AFTER: I love this soap, yea I already love dead sea salt & how softening, moisturizing & just great for skin health it is, so adding it into a bar of soap for me makes it perfect. This soap is smooth & is not at all gritty when using it, not harsh & has a mild scent, the scent does not bother me but might bother others. This soap is great to use for general skin health but is also great for skin issues such as eczema, rough dry skin, psoriasis, hives, rashes acne & more. What I tend to hate about even natural soaps is they leave behind a residue especially if they have any kind of salt in them, this soap not only does not leave behind any residue it rinses off very easily & leaves your skin feeling amazing.You have got to love a soap that is natural, healing, soothing & has soap magnesium, potassium, sodium, zinc & more for a total of 21 minerals needed for skin health & body health. Feel the rich lather that makes you feel like you are not using soap at all, then feel how great it makes your skin feel & look & how others are noticing the great results.Thank you to Adovia for making all these great skin care products, I love what I have tried so far,great company with great communication that really cares about the customers & that is important when buying online.

  BEFORE: <none>
  AFTER: Thus far I like the product and the results. Would repurchase and recommend.  Next time I will probaby order one that has a scent like coconut or lavender.  The product is thick as other reviews have indicated but I like that b/c it does help &#34;lay them edges&#34; or sealing ends when rocking a twist and/or braid out.  I have also mixed with other oils like coconut and/or jojoba when using as co-wash, deep conditioning, or with leave-in conditioners.

  AFTER: OMG! I love this Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap! When I first heard this product, I thought the soap was going to be rough or grainy because of the &#34;Dead Sea Salt&#34; but, I was so wrong. When I opened the box for the first time, the scent was strong, but I liked the scent. It's a very clean, fresh, almost kind of an ivory scent. I put it in my shower and left and when I returned the whole bathroom smelled so nice. And, even after I use it in the shower, there is still a nice lingering fragrance on my skin after each use. It lathers very well and rinses off without leaving any residue. My skin feels so soft and smooth afterward, especially my face! Some soaps leave your face dry, this one leaves my face feeling fresh, clean and moisturized... This bar of soap is amazing and it feels great! I'm going to continue to use this product and recommend it to everyone!Disclosure: I was not financially compensated for this post.

  AFTER: My daughter and wife have very sensitive skin. Regular soaps irritate their skin and make them break out. We have a water softener that helps, but we needed more help. We were given the chance to try the soap. My wife loves it. This is what she says about this great soap.It has a light, but nice fragranceIt has a nice lather that makes her skin feel goodThere is no residue left on the skin like many of the store bought soaps. We also have a water softener which makes this soap last a long time.The soap makes her skin feel softer and healthierWe see an improvement in my daughter's skin.

  AFTER: As I've reached the age of 50, my lashes have thinned out quite a bit.  NYX Doll Eye Mascara does add volume, but it can get a bit thick and waxy on the second pass of the brush.  If you can successully apply only one coat without drying, it looks great.  It doesn't smudge and wears well.  It is a bit difficult to remove, but I am only using warm soapy water when doing so.

  AFTER: I do not know what I was thinking buying this. I think when you have or had acne you are willing to try anything for the little marks left behind. It might work for others but I personally can not see myself doing this on a regular basis, I mean you are poking your face with hundreds of small needles. It made my face itchy and uncomfortable days after using it I also workout on a regular basis and sweating made me nervous of possible infection.You have to be committed to used this product I certainly can not poke my face regularly even though I thought I would.

If only I had tried Aveeno when it was first recommended, I would have spared myself much misery, multiple doctor visits, and a bag of useless prescription creams. After the first use, my itching was gone; within 3 uses the rashes had disappeared. For the first time in 40 years of pricey daily lotions and oils, my skin doesn't look dry at the end of the day. This body wash is AWESOME!

  AFTER: I have dry skin, and using the oil cleansing method rather than washing with soap has saved my skin. My skin never feels dry and tight any more. It's always comfortable. At night, I use one part of this castor oil to three parts of coconut oil. It takes off all my makeup, including eye makeup. Eye makeup slides right off. It's great. In the morning I don't use soap on my face, I just rinse it.I've heard this is also good for getting rid of age spots. I am developing some, so I've started treating them with castor oil. I also apply this to my eyebrows to stimulate hair growth. I love this product and highly recommend it.

  AFTER: I guess you can call me a mascara junkie in that I like to try different brands and don't usually stick to one brand for too long.  I also try never to spend more than $10. on any mascara--the way I see it either the mascara works or it doesn't in terms of easy application, longer and thicker lashes, low or no clumpiness.  This mascara fits the bill in all those important respects and sells at a good price.  I have already ordered a second tube, that's how much I like it, I don't want to run out of it.  I give it a "4" though because I don't think it is hypoallergenic, plus it is marked as being made in Korea....I don't know what the standards are for makeup in other countries.Several months later, I found that every time I wore this mascara my eyes would have a burning sensation which I never had with other mascaras.  Sure enough, I switched to other mascaras and the burning sensation stopped.  Nervous about the ingredients now so wouldn't use it again.

  AFTER: I read in amazon reviews that this lotion could do wonders for dry skin, and that it worked basically all over, face and body. I was getting a lot of irritation after shaving and was not very pleased with the different after shave lotions I used over the years, so I gave this one a try. Besides the negative information regarding the dispenser being almost useless after a while, which I must admit that so far it still works in my case but I can tell not very well, the lotion itself seems to be doing just fine as part of a daily ritual.It certainly competes with the likes of Vaseline, Lubriderm, etc, etc., and well worth trying it out. I have been using it for the better part of one month and so far I like what it does. 4 Stars.

  AFTER: I like this product combine with an anti wrinkle cream it works well or with the anti wrinkle patch. Ok, this product you must be careful with to much pressure on the eye area will hurt.  So roll lightly.  It is like a little meat tenderizer that allows the cream, lotions, serum etc., to penetrate theskin so you will get faster results.  I liked it but stopped using it after a week, so I only gave it three stars.  But now that i am writing this review i will start using it again tonight.  Happy rolling!

  AFTER: I'm using this in combination with coconut oil to put on my scalp to promote healthy hair growth and supposedly it helps with thickness so we'll see about that in a few months from now. It's pretty thick so you're gonna need to mix it with another oil if you apply it to your scalp, at least that's what I had to do.

  AFTER: I really feel that this has helped me from getting wrinkles.  I am in my thirties and I have used this product for about three years.  If you like other Olay products (I love the Microgenerist), Olay sometimes has a rebate (a good one) for spending $50 on their products.  The only thing I don't like is that it has no sunscreen.

  AFTER: I broke my ankle last winter and still have a lot of pain when I walk. I read some articles that said black castor oil was good for ache and pains as well as hair, skin, lashes and eyebrows. Majority of it is used on my ankle and I can honestly say that the first day I used it the pain went away!  Just to make sure I was'nt tripping out I had my mother to try it on her ankle and did not say anything eto her about it.  She was in a car accident years ago and her ankle got broke and she has had pain in it every since and nothing seems to help she even have had cortisone shots for it.  After she put it on her ankle she came eto be about 20 min. after and ask what was it because her pain was gone and she wanted more of it!  I gave her half of the bottle and niether one of us have been in pain.  I dont know how well it works for the hair,skin, lashes and eyebrows, but it is GREAT FOR PAIN!

  AFTER: The only thing that I found true about this product's description - it has stayed "clump free"... BUT it absolutely DOES NOT give 200 times the volume like the description says.  I have used far better formulas - this one did not add volume or length; it only darkened existing lashes.Another downer about my order...I received the product in "brown" instead of "very black" which is what my order said I would receive.I think I will keep looking.

  AFTER: As I have dry skin, I personally do not prefer to use soap because it makes my skin more drier. I have previously tried their Mud Soap which i loved using it.That's why I expected a lot about this soap as well. To be honest, I am slightly disappointed about this soap! I know many people like this soap and even saw some videos where they used it directly on the face!! I can finally tell you that this soap works just like the regular body soap.It does clean very well,although it dries my skin like hell! I dare to use it on my face though! It smell nice like regular soap and this soap last for a long time i guess because it still in my bathroom! &#9786; One more thing I would like to mention that I use to wash my clothes with this soap, lol! and it does clean well and smell good as well.Overall, I think this soap works just like regular soap and kinda dry me out.So I would probably not going to repurchase it again!

  AFTER: I've used Covergirl products for years.  I'm pleased with this mascara.  It really is a Clump Crusher!  There's nothing worse than clumps of mascara joining 2 or 3 lashes together.  The curved, plastic brush is easy to use and keeps lashes defined.  My eyes look great behind my glasses.  I recommend Covergirl Clump Crusher.It's not just for girls - I haven't been a girl for decades but still like to use natural looking eye makeup.  I think it's almost more important as I've gotten older so I don't look faded or cranky.Well done Covergirl.

I packed my bar into my suitcase for my recent beach vacation and it was such a great thing to do. Perfect for all of the sand, salt and chlorine that vacations bring.

  AFTER: This mascara is okay. As it claims, it adds volume and a little length without clumping. The biggest drawback, however, is that it starts flaking after a couple of hours, leaving a residue under my lower lashes. I usually use Covergirl's "professional" mascara, and although I don't think it provides quite as much volume as this one does, it doesn't flake or smear, no matter how long I wear it. Every other mascara I've tried does one or the other. This one didn't smear, but flaking was an issue.

  AFTER: This soap helps to defeat dry skin!  I love this soap and cannot say enough good things about it.  It smells great and rinses clean with no film or residue. It also gently exfoliates your skin.  I started using it on my face but when I saw how much better my skin looked started using it on my whole body.  Let me give you some back story about my skin, it is a dry, flaky, rashy, hot mess.  So when I first tried this soap I wasn't expecting much. After using in once, I noticed the skin on my face wasn't tight feeling like it is when I use my normal soap.  My face was soft and smooth.  So I tried it on the rest of my body, and what a difference it has made! I now longer have to apply lotion continuously all day long. Once and I'm good to go!  Also, I'm not trying to make any health claims or anything.  It could just be coincidence but after using this soap for a week, the eczema on my arms ( that has been there for years) has cleared considerably, and my skin is no longer painfully dry.  If you have skin issues, give this soap a try and see how it works for you. For me it has really made a difference! Thanks Adovia!

  AFTER: To start, I am a huge fan of bar soaps. I love how little packaging they have in comparison to liquid soaps, and I also love that what packaging they do have is usually a box which is biodegradable. I'm all about reducing my waste so I don't have to worry about reusing or recycling much, and bar soaps help with that goal.So I'm going in expecting to be pleased, and I was overwhelmed! This is hands-down the most moisturizing bar soap I have ever tried, and I've used absolutely wonderful, hand-made, cold-processed goat's milk soaps. Don't expect this soap to rinse squeaky clean - it leaves a slight film of something softening on your skin that soaks right in as soon as it's dried. You don't feel anything but smooth, supple skin after you wash with this. I can definitely skip moisturizer on my face when I use it to wash away the day, and I don't find my hands drying out nearly as much as they do with normal bar soaps - or even other good ones.It's also a hefty, solid bar that's incredibly long-lasting. Most of the really moisturizing bar soaps I've tried have melted away quite easily, especially if left in damp places (like the shower). This one just keeps going and going...I've used it multiple times a day for nearly two weeks straight now, and you'd hardly be able to tell by looking at it - the logo has barely worn smooth.About the only thing that approaches a negative for me is the scent. It's very reminiscent of &#34;old lady perfume&#34; smells to me - that really heavy, heady floral-type fragrance. It's incredibly strong in this soap, so much so that it constantly fills the room with the scent, even when you aren't using it. Fortunately, though, it doesn't linger much on the skin, so I don't wind up smelling it all day long. Thanks to that, I really don't have much of a complaint about the smell.Honestly, it's hard to say anything bad about this product - I absolutely love it, the price is reasonable, and I'm definitely prepared to order more!

Unfortunately, at 9 months, mine developed an exceptionally loud buzzing noise that makes me feel I'm going to go deaf using it, so I'm replacing it.  I hate to replace a hair dryer at just 9 months, but thankfully it's very inexpensive!

  AFTER: This glitter is a heavy glitter.  I have searched futilely for a very fine glitter in regular nail polish, and it seems that no one but me wants just a touch of glitter on my nail base color sometimes.  Then I found IBD soak-off gel Fireworks, which gives me that tasteful sparkle.  It is gorgeous with a 2 coat application over a deep red, and being a gel, it holds up for over two weeks.  What isn't to like?  If you're like me and sometimes want only a light glitter, not a heavy, thick, extremely flashy glitter, you won't be disappointed with Fireworks. Or, if you are in the mood for more bling on your nails, you can't go wrong with All That Glitters.

  AFTER: This bar soap is very moisturizing and lathers up really nicely. It's perfect for anyone with dry or normal/dry skin, since it hydrates so well. The bar itself is a nice thick size - bigger than most other bar soaps I have used - so it will last quite awhile. I'm usually not a fan of bar soaps since they tend to leave my skin dry, but this soap is as moisturizing and sudsy as a body wash cream. And the best part is that it contains natural ingredients from the earth.At first I was just using the soap on my body in the shower, until I realized I should be using it on my face too, as the directions state. I always get kind of nervous when trying new cleansers on my face and I've never tried a facial bar soap before, but man, this one really impressed me! I have sensitive skin and didn't have any irritation or redness, like I usually do after washing my face. I could feel all the dry skin being washed away, and it looks like it helped clear out my pores as well. This soap rinsed away easily and left my face feeling super clean and soft. I'm so excited to finally have a soap that doesn't leave my face red after using it! It's gentle and moisturizing, which is exactly what I need.

  AFTER: Great polish.  I bought the Sally Hansen kit but didn't want to spend so much money on their polish.  Some people complain that the polish runs when curing.  Even though the description says you don't need the base coat, you STILL need it.  The base coat gets sticky after curing and therefore allows the polish to adhere to the base coat.  I do a lot of gardening and dish washing and bathing my child.  My nails last for 2 weeks.  I have bought 3 other colors and they all work great.  I plan to buy more...maybe next time I will post a pic!

  AFTER: I love the heavy mascara but I am careful to remove excess by 'batting my eyelashes&#34; against a tissue both by looking up and down.  That removes the excess and lets it dry carefully.  Still have to separate those eyelashes sometimes, though.  Still, can't beat the coverage.

  AFTER: I heard many great things about this brand so I decided to order one after trying the ZGTS brand. First off, this roller is waaaaaaaay less painful than the ZGTS. Even though I am using 1.0 from this brand and used 1.5 for the ZGTS, the length of the needles have nothing to do with the pain level at all. The ZGTS needles are really tough and painful due to them being made out of titanium steel which is supposely suppose to help the needles last longer which is complete bull! The needles are also placed different so you have some cross action rows going on. I will give it another month or two to see if it works for me and will definitely lower my rating if I dont see any improvements to my skin.

  AFTER: There are several key things that I look for when it comes to trying a new soap or body wash: scent, lather, how easily it washes off the skin, how my skin feels afterwards (including if my skin feels moisturized or dried out), if I can use it on my face/shave with it and how long the soap lasts. I wasted no time in putting this soap to the test.Scent- This soap smells AMAZING. The best way I can describe the scent is to say that it smells really &#34;clean&#34;. There is something else to the scent (faint floral notes?) but I can not place it. I thought the smell was a little overpowering when I first removed it from the box, but it isn't overpowering as you use it in the shower. It actually makes your entire bathroom smell amazing for hours after your shower. The scent also lingers a little on your skin (not a lot, but enough to be pleasant and make you feel clean).Lather- This soap not only lathers well, but it does so easily. You use very little of the soap when in the shower.How easily does it wash off the skin- Very easily. It does not stick to your skin or make you feel like you have to work to rinse it off.How does my skin feel after using- I feel really clean and smell amazing. The soap does not dry out my skin at all like most soaps do. My skin doesn't necessarily feel moist, but it doesn't feel dry or sore either. It feels soft, clean and healthy.Can I use it on my face/shave with it- Yes! If I use other bar soaps on my face it is peeling and dry when I get out of the shower. I have been using this Adovia Mineral Soap on my face for 2 weeks with no peeling or dryness. It makes my face feel so much cleaner than the facial wash I was using previously. I love it on my face! I have also not had as many breakouts. I have also been using this to shave. Since it lathers so well and is not drying, it makes shaving really easy.How long does the soap last- Well, I have been using this soap for about 2 weeks now. As of now the bar looks almost the original size. You can even still faintly see the Adovia stamp on the bar. It appears that this Adovia Mineral Soap will last for a long time.As you can see, the Adovia Dead Sea Salt Moisturizing Mineral Soap passed all of my tests with flying colors. The soap is currently on sale on Amazon for $11 with free shipping for everyone. I normally would not spend that much on a bar of soap, but this soap is definitely worth trying. I recommend it!

Besides this moisturizer is in reasonable price, but come with amazing result, highly recommended to others.But just to be fair, I don&#8217;t like the smell, but I would give it a 5 stars.

  AFTER: After I used the product, I went on Amazon's site to order the mascara for my daughter and some friends.  I was more than pleasantly surprised that if I purchased it through Amazon, the price was ultra reasonable at $6.00+.  I have used all types of mascaras and for the money, this is really worth it.  I have tried it for a few days, and it does NOT clump or smear below or above my eyes.  I cannot tell you how many expensive mascaras I have used only to be told, "you have some black stuff on your face and in your eyebrows! " Since my eyes tear, I expected some runny marks, but there were none.  The mascara separates the lashes but it does not add volume, so don't expect a fuller lash look.I must admit I was skeptical because of the packaging.  It comes in the hard-to-open bubble wrap, or whatever it is called, which takes a scissors and patience to open. It cheapens the product.  The casing is also tinny;  Covergirl did not put the money into the quality of the tube but I like the green color, I will always find it in my purse!  The wand can be used for different strokes to apply or replenish the product.  For the money, Covergirl is providing the consumer with a quality cosmetic.

  AFTER: It made my hair crunchy and dry. I guess it's just my hair texture, and I have 4C hair, but it made it crunchy. Maybe you're only supposed to use it on the scalp, because I used it on the length of my hair.

It is not only unscented - but doesn't have any fragrance at all which is fantastic - it doesnt even smell like lotion so you can then wear perfume without any clash of scents.  Leaves my skin smooth and super soft.  On a 1-10 scale...this lotion gets an 11.

I also use this on my face... does not break me out, it's perfect!  It does, however, leave a bit of a "gummy" texture on your skin. But that will not affect repurchasing for me.

  AFTER: Like another reviewer, I also have weird eyelashes, my right lashes curl down over my eye, but my left side is just fine.Every mascara I've tried in the past has just pulled the curl right out of my right lashes and down go my lashes over my eye, very annoying.I bought this based on the rave reviews, it shipped literally the next day so I tried it out, didn't expect much, but to my surprise my lashes held a curl! They didn't curl back down over my eye. My lashes on both sides also had length they never had before, but not fake stiff looking length. Also no flakes, no clumps and I didn't have to scrape it off at the end of the day, it came off like nothing with just a little eye make up remover.SO happy with this mascara, I finally found a winner.

  AFTER: I have been meaning to try this Olay product ever sinceGood Housekeeping (1-year auto-renewal)tested it, and said it was better than a $500 cream they also tested.  Well, either they changed the ingredients in this product, or I don't have the same skin type the testers had, because this cream did nothing but make my skin look duller.  It was too thick.  Now, on toOlay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream, 1.7 Ouncefor two months . . . .

I use it every other day after a thorough face and neck cleansing and prior to applying evening products.  It does not hurt if used properly and does open your skin to be more receptive to your toners, vitamin applications and moisturizers.  Try one, I believe you will be pleased with it.  I am.

  AFTER: First off, let me say I am not in any way benefitting from this review.....I was amazed at the results.  A little about myself: I'm 40 and have recently (intentionally) lost over 30 pounds, have had a stressful last six months, and have an expressive face (I wrinkle my eyebrows a lot). So I started to notice creases above my eyebrows.  Stress, weight loss, and my continued eye wrinkling started to show. Ugh.  I can't afford medical intervention, but knew that I needed to do something. Just like everyone else ... I had seen the Olay commercials. I'm a natural born skeptic and hate to waste money.  $20-- ok, worth a try.I used the cream (light, non greasy, lovely) one night before bed. The forehead creases are noticeably diminished after only one day's use. I looked more rested and fresh faced.  I was completely surprised. I am anxious to see what a week's worth of use will do.

  AFTER: After years of buying a $25 a tube mascara, I'm going back to Covergirl.  This mascara is pretty great.  The wand has very stiff ridges that comb through your lashes as you apply it.  It's basically impossible to clump.  It also gave my lashes great lift without having to use an eyelash curler, and even by the end of the day, my lashes were still lifted...that never happens.  The formula is thin, so if your looking for crazy volume, this isn't going to deliver.  But for extreme definition and lift, this mascara is fantastic.

It dries my hair in five minutes, compared to twenty minutes with my old dragon dryer (you know the one, practically spits fire and weighs a ton!).  This does blow fast, even on low, but that is the great thing about it! The dryer is so LIGHT! 14.8 ounces to be exact! I just can't tell you enough about why I love it! The shipping was free, and the price was half what it is in the store.  If you have fragile hair, this is for you. If you have thick hair, this is for you. If you have frizzy hair, fine hair, any hair.. well you get the idea!

  AFTER: While I occasionally splurge on Buxom Lash mascara, my tried and true mascaras seem to be the newer series of Cover Girl ones that have come out in the last few years orAlmay One Coat Get Up and Grow Mascara, Black, 0.21-Ounce.  While some folks hate the large brush and tube of these newer ones, I don't mind them, and I love the new bristle brushes that coat without leaving clumps.  I've already had good luck using the regular Lash Blast (the one in the orange tube), but I thought I'd try this new one to see how it works.  I really like it, and it really does leave zero clumps!The curved brush on this also does a nice job of adding a gentle curl to your lashes. The non-waterproof formula stays put, even when my allergies are acting up and my eyes are teary.I bought this in the Very Black color, and it's still natural-looking.Like all Cover Girl mascaras, this also comes off easily, with just some eye makeup remover or face wash and water.  You don't have to tug or pull at your eyes.It's a keeper!

  AFTER: As I've reached the age of 50, my lashes have thinned out quite a bit.  NYX Doll Eye Mascara does add volume, but it can get a bit thick and waxy on the second pass of the brush.  If you can successully apply only one coat without drying, it looks great.  It doesn't smudge and wears well.  It is a bit difficult to remove, but I am only using warm soapy water when doing so.

I am using it in my &#34;travel&#34; makeup bag now.

  AFTER: First of all I must say that this oil is about the best thing you can put on your skin. I had known about castor oil's reputation as a laxative and hair growth aid, but I'm very skeptic with "miracle" products, even when they're natural. But I have to say that this oil really impressed me. I have been using different natural oils like coconut and olive oil infused with rosemary leaves on my hair with very good results, but 2 days ago I applied this oil to my scalp and hair and went to bed with a shower cap on. I washed my hair the next morning and I was amazed at the luxurious softness of my hair, with a healthy shine and with volume, not a single sign of greasiness whatsoever. Just soft, beautiful hair. It actually feels like baby hair. Another thing is that I noticed much less hair breakage and shedding when I combed my hair in the shower. Just a few strands, because my hair was so smooth it did not tangle much. My hair is relaxed, colored, thin and dry and breaks easy, but I'm sure this oil is going to help me keep it moisturized and with less breakage.It also works very well on the skin, although I've never used it on my face, except my eyelids, eyelashes and eyebrows. I apply it all over my body every night after a shower and I wake up with baby soft skin that is not greasy. The oil is thick and kind of sticky for a minute, but your skin will absorb it completely after a while and it won't feel greasy. It makes my skin feel more elastic and young, and I only get that feeling with expensive firming creams I cannot afford to use all over. It is not completely odorless, but the smell is very faint and kind of goes away after a few minutes and it's easily covered up with lotion or cologne. It's great for dry lips and tired looking eyes. I apply a tiny drop on my eyelids and the area where dark circles form and massage. The next morning my eyes look fresh and eyelids and nice and plump. My son has chronic eczema and this oil keeps his skin nicely moisturized and doesn't irritate his skin like most creams do. I also put some on my hands before doing the dishes and protects my hands. This oil is a godsend and I see myself using it for years to come. I wish I could give it 10 stars.

Even though I cried with this mascara on my face did not look like I was slapped in the face by a black pain brush. Removing the mascara was quite easy and it did give me some volume/length but I still prefer loreal voluminous mascara(cheaper). I still find this mascara as an alternative :)

  AFTER: Aging baby boomers, my wife and I don't get out as much as we once did, but we do still go out occasionally. My wife has always used very light makeup, but she still uses mascara to highlight her eyes and long lashes. When she developed a slight tremble in her hands a couple of years ago, she was concerned about applying mascara for fear of injuring her eyes, so I volunteered to apply it. Surprisingly, she accepted my offer. One of her biggest gripes about mascara is its tendency to clump and look messy, so she was glad to try Clump Crusher.The product comes in a sealed bottle with a separate brush that you can see through the packaging. The brush is slightly curved at the applicator end, which has dozens of very fine bristles about 1.5 mm long. The round brush's handle is about 0.9" in diameter, which makes it easy to hold. That's the obvious stuff.In use, we both appreciated how the fine bristles separated and coated her lashes evenly with no noticeable clumping. I applied one coat of the mascara to both her eyes around noon yesterday, then we left the house for about seven hours to deliver Christmas presents and have dinner at a restaurant. When we returned, we both examined her eyes and found no smudging or flaking, even with a few tears shed at one stop. Later that evening, my wife removed the mascara with a washcloth and warm soapy water. It removed fairly easily with no visible traces left.Overall, the Covergirl Clump Crusher Mascara appears to be a fine product that works as advertised. My wife is sold on the product.

  AFTER: This was just an okay product to me. I did find that this product clumped (despite the name) and it really didn't lengthen or thicken.

  AFTER: I like it, but it has to be thinned out for my use because it is too thick. I always mixed it with other oils and conditioner when using on hair, and other oils when using on scalp. I really didn't care for it on my scalp and after two tries gave up.I love the strong earthy scent. It kind of reminds me of dirt. I think the oil is very moisturizing when mixed with other things, and helps give hair nice shine and sheen when used with conditioner for a deep conditioning treatment. For me I think this is not a product I need to use or will repurchase. I can get the same effects using coconut oil in my conditioners. Despite that I like this oil and would recommend it.

  AFTER: I started using this recently and really like how my skin feels clean but not tight or dry. I have been using it morning and again in the evening. I put on my usual moisturizers and makeup during the day and at night I use it to clean my face of all the makeup and then I use my moisturizers.  My skin looks and feels good.  I love that it is 100% all natural too..there are no weird ingredients.  I was noticing a little flaking and dry skin prior to starting with the soap but after I started using the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Soap it seemed to stop. My skin has been looking really nice and it feels comfortable, not tight or dry.

  AFTER: Initially doubtful, but with this facial Keloid on my left facial cheek for the past 52 years....I was willing to give it a try and what a difference!  Honestly , I kept saying why didn't I know about this before?  I had been to dermatologists, surgeons etc.... but I had purchased a social media offer for a microdermabraise and the skin specialist told me about this.  I took a chance, checked with Amazon and bought two of these and became rather faithful for 2 months.... what a difference.... people tell me they can't even tell I have a scar... that is with foundation.. but still the lumpy scarred appearance has softened significantly!

  AFTER: I've always had a problem with mascara clumping. A trick I learned from a makeup artist is to very gently roll the wand in a tissue before applying; it works. This mascara is really good at NOT clumping right out of the bottle. However, it doesn't seem to build & lengthen my lashes as much as my L'Oreal Voluminous mascara. I needed to apply 2 coats to get my lashes thick looking (like the L'Oreal does in one coat) and after doing that, my lashes were mostly uncurled. I've always felt that the CoverGirl mascaras are too wet/thin. They tend to make my eyelashes "uncurl"/straighten out after curling & applying the mascara. This new formula is better than others but still uncurls.The positive part is this mascara did not clump even with 2 coats. But, my nicely curled lashes were no longer very curled. It does wear well; minimal flaking & no smudge after a long day. So I guess if you prefer minimal thickening/lengthening of your eyelashes, this would be a good product for you. I'm not sure I'll keep using it because I prefer a thicker looking lash but it is a good mascara & worth a try if you've had problems with clumping.

  AFTER: I don't do anything with a hairdryer except dry my hair (meaning I don't use it to "style" my hair).  This hairdryer does dry hair.  It's not as lightweight as you might think (which is why I bought it).  It's really kind of bulky.  Also, the buttons are too easy to push and located right where you hold the thing, so I'm constantly turning the dryer off when I'm using it..... annoying.  I guess I shouldn't complain too much about a product that didn't cost much.

  AFTER: I've been using a Vidal Sassoon travel hair dryer for years and it was time to replace it.  I started looking at more expensive brands and was about to pay $139 on a light weight Sedu.  I asked my hairdresser for recommendations and she actually told me to save my money and buy a drug store brand.  After reading all of the reviews on Amazon, I settled on the Revlon RV544.  It's bigger than my travel hair dryer but it's about the same weight and it's a lot more powerful.  I've only used it a few times but I like it.  Unlike some reviewers, I don't find the buttons poorly placed and I think the cord is a good length.  Bottom line, you can't beat the Revlon RV544 for the price.UPDATE:  I've changed my mind about this blow dryer.  I have a lot of fine, layered hair. The blow dryer doesn't give my hair body.  I thought my hair was looking flat because I was in need of a hair cut.  Then I used a blow dryer at my gym and my hair looked fine.  I realized that it's not my hair, it's the dryer.NEW BOTTOM LINE:  Based on the positive reviews, I think this hair dryer is good for people with thick or curly or frizzy hair.  I can't recommend it for people with fine hair.

That said, I'm not sure this cream is any better than Regenerist Nightly Moisturizer.  I switched over because of all of the hype but haven't noticed any real difference or improvement.  For those who are just starting a nightly moisturizer routine, this cream may be better than the less expensive Nightly Moisturizer.  But, I think I'll switch back.  Both products are excellent.

  AFTER: WOW LOVE THIS HAIR DRYER. I called my stylist and asked her which is the best and gave her a couple choices.  She said Tourmaline Ionic Dryer. You can't beat this hair dryer and as one review from a stylist said she loves it and it is affordable vs. hundreds of $$$'s for the same thing that stylists use.  I use it with a Tourmaline Brush and I have curly hair which frizzes especially at the ends.  The tools it comes with like the finger styler and the round attachment for curly hair and a great dryer for this price is a great buy and I'm glad that it is affordable because not everyone can afford what they need. I'm grateful for the deal I got the day I purchased.  If I don't use my brush iron and wish to only use the dryer and my special brush then all I have to do is put a little pure argan oil on the ends and it smooths out the little friz on the ends.  Should I go curly the attachment is awesome. Helps to make the curls a nice style.  Shipping was on schedule and I'm a very happy customer. Almost forgot to add that you do get more shine as well. 100% happy.

  AFTER: I've tried many brands of mascara, both expensive and cheap, over the years. I just adore this stuff! It doesn't clump, flake, or smudge. It combs out perfectly and truly makes my lashes appear longer. I apply this after setting my makeup withSkindinavia Makeup Finishing Spray, 2 Ounce, so that I don't lose the curl after crimping. After putting a coat of this on for length, I then apply several coats ofCovergirl Lashblast Fusion Water Resistant Mascara Very Black 885, 0.44-Ounce. These two work beautifully together, and I've even been asked if I was wearing fake lashes. I believe the tools you use can make all the difference, so immediately after I've applied my mascara, I'll comb through my lashes withTweezerman Folding Lash Comb. My lashes turn out perfectly every time. *Note: if you do use this type of *needle* comb for your lashes, you must be extremely careful not to poke your eye out.

Pro-x results are sooner than this product. All their products have to be used daily or every few days, otherwise you lose your results. They do work though! I have a pretty dry dehydrated face and can tell a huge difference with all of the Olay products.

  AFTER: I really like the IBD products because they are good quality, great price, and the bottles are much larger than their more expensive counterparts.But after using this basecoat, my daughter and I both discovered that the polish started peeling off after about 5 days.  My daughter used it first and I thought she just had "oily nails", but when I finally used it, the same thing happened.  The top coat and polish are okay because I'd used them many times; it's just the basecoat.

  AFTER: I love nude colors I have a gelish nude that is extremely runny, I was hoping this would be better but unfortunately is not.  Not as runny but pretty sheer even with 3 coats. Love this brand and it arrived fast but I won't purchase this color again.

  AFTER: This oil is thick and kind of sticky it stays on my hair a lot longer than other oils. My hair is super thirsty, so I am always having to apply oil to it. I like that I can oil my hair twice a week instead of four times a week. It also promotes hair grow which is what I am trying to achieve right now. I would tell anyone who has dry hair to try Castor oil it really works.

  AFTER: I am disappointed with this one.....it goes on very heavy....even after I wipe the brush down. I wouldn't even dare to layer it on 2 or 3 times as many others do. I like fluffy, light, separated looking lashes and this one isn't doing it for me :( The only thing I like about this item is that the brush has a flat end that is good to use as a liner on the bottom lashes, I like to smudge it.UPDATE: so I have been using this one for  couple of months and I guess it dried out a bit,.....it goes on much better now....I can even sometimes manage fluffy, natural looking, non-clumpy lashes ....so.....it gets better with use :)  The sad thing is-this mascara is very hard to remove. Unless you have a very very good cleanser, you gonna have to use eye makeup remover afterall to make sure that you get it all off.....don't like loosing my lashes :) I am going to leave the rating at 2 stars still. I am going to try another mascara once I use up this one.

  AFTER: I used to be a Lubriderm girl, but the formulation seemed a little watery and I thought the moisturizing effect eroded pretty quickly. I tried this and am amazed. It's not greasy or sticky, but even hours later, your skin feels moisturized and protected. This is incredible stuff. I am a La Mer person for the face, and now and Aveeno girl for the body.

  AFTER: I purchased the iceberg color and love it.  It's different because its a mix between blue and gray.  I have been using this for abut a month but lately I have noticed it has been peeling off my nails much faster than the prior 2 weeks I would get out of it.  Maybe it is my fault for not applying it as well as it could be.  Who knows. Great price and overall great product!

  AFTER: This hair dryer is the third in a series of attempts to find the right hair dryer for my wife, who has long thick hair.  The first one was a Vidal Sassoon that had ionic technology, but didn't get near hot enough.  She was drying her hair for > 20 minutes.The second attempt was the Revlon RV469 ceramic, which was much quieter and got hotter, but didn't have much air flow.  Also, it is quite heavy.  It was better than the first dryer, but not hair drying nirvana.This dryer (Revlon RV544) has easily cut my wife's drying time in half.  She has very thick & long hair, and the high heat setting makes quick work of it.  It gets hot enough that I actually tone it down to warm for myself (I have short, thick hair) whenever I have to use the dryer.  I think the air flow settings are perfect.  The dryer is also nice and light, and fits in a bathroom drawer easily, unlike some of the bulkier models out there.My wife thinks this is the best dryer she has ever had.  We highly recommend it.

  AFTER: I have ordered several ibd gel polishes, and the quality and price cannot be beat!  This is a pale lavender color that really doesn't do much for me.  It's a personal preference thing.

  AFTER: Bought this because I wanted to replace Too Faced Lash Injection Pinpoint since its become so hard to find and dries out too fast for the price. The mascara itself is great but I don't get the brush (sort of a curvy hourglass shape--why??). This might just be me because I've been using the incredibly shallow bristles of the pinpoint mascara for years and I like to work in my mascara a little thicker at the base of my lashes instead of bothering with eyeliner most days. I find it very difficult to apply this evenly without a few smudges on my eyelids. It CAN be a little spidery.Best aspect: it doesn't smudge or run when my eyes water, when I yawn a billion times a day, when I sweat or when my skin gets oily. It does smush in a gooey way if I cry and rub my eyes, but that's much better than flaking or running. I live in Savannah, Georgia and it has no trouble with the humidity. I've also slept in it a few times without it smudging or running at all, which is amazing.

  AFTER: I'm super picky about my mascara and have used the same brand forever but after trying this it is now my new fave!  The brush is really good not your typical super bristly kind.

  AFTER: I love the heavy mascara but I am careful to remove excess by 'batting my eyelashes&#34; against a tissue both by looking up and down.  That removes the excess and lets it dry carefully.  Still have to separate those eyelashes sometimes, though.  Still, can't beat the coverage.

  AFTER: I received a low value free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review. I was not required or compelled to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with FTC 16 CFR, Part 255.I like that this Soap contains Dead Sea Salt and Minerals from the Dead Sea located in Israel. Both ingredients known to provide healing benefits to the human body.This soap come in a small box that well represents Adovia's design and standards. The Soap it self is a good size and it should last for some time.It has a nice scent, but it is very strong, and it made my allergies go a bit crazy. So I was not really able to use it on my face, but I have been using it for my body and do like how fresh and soft it leaves my skin.As much as I like Adovia Products, and while I did like the end results of the Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap, I think it's a bit on the high price, and I'm not sure that I would buy it because of my allergies. If on the other hand you enjoy or don't mind strong scents and are looking for a high quality soap that offers many benefits this may just be the soap for you.A fact that many may find appealing is that this soap can be freely used on the body and on a delicate face as well. Leaving the skin clean, refreshing and soft feeling.I wrote a more detailed review at our site, you are welcome to check it out at craftyspices {dot} com

  AFTER: Well, if you say this roller doesn't hurt, you are kidding yourself. It does hurt, a lot too. However, this is when you apply pressure. But, if you keep it within the same area, the pain lessens. I was excited to receive this based on other reviews and my own personal research. I have since used the product about five times. At first, I used it a couple of times every other day, then I started waiting a week in between rolling. Your face does feel like you got a sunburn afterwards. Some people say it goes away within an hour, for me, it takes at least a day. After 24 hours, my skin looks plumped up. Although, it appears to get back to normal after three days (or two). I think it's working, but I can't be 100% sure. My skin seems to look better than it did when I first used it. I'm going to keep working with this. I have tried many other ways to boost collagen, so as long as I follow instructions, I don't see how it can hurt.

  AFTER: This mascara was actually my first foray into the world of NYX... Aka, my current obsession! I came across Doll Eye while trying to find a mascara that was not tested on animals, as the thought of animal cruelty makes me ill.The stuff works well. I'd compare it to Boots No. 7 Volumizing mascara. Unfortunately, there's no &#34;wow&#34; factor. My friends all use Benefit and L'oreal, and Maybelline and get much more definitive results. I guess I've just got to keep searching for my holy grail of mascaras.Thanks for reading!

  AFTER: I bought this item on April 18, 2013 and started using it immediately on fine lines on my face and a selected amount of stretch marks on my stomach.  A little over 6 weeks later, I'm writing a review to report my experience.LOVE!I mainly wanted to get rid of the "11"'s between my eyes.  I won't inject poison into my face so this was the next best option.  Many people report that it didn't work for them but I am reporting that it worked for me!  Are they gone?  No, that wouldn't be possible.  Those are muscles that have been trained over more than 3 decades of repeated facial movements.  In my case, I squinted a lot.  But....they DO look A LOT better.  They are not nearly as deep or noticeable.  I am very fair skinned, red hair, freckles so any blemish on my skin is obvious (to me anyway).Another area I tried was a small acne scar.  It is completely gone now.  It used to be a small dent in my face, sort of like a dimple.  There was a white "thing" in it that I would pick at.  It's gone too!The fine lines around my eyes are noticeably gone - seriously, I look like I am 5 years younger in that area. The lines around my mouth (nasolabial folds) are noticeably less pronounced.  This particular device isn't really suited to handle the lines around my lips.I had a brown spot on my cheek, it's completely gone now.  All over, my face looks brighter, smoother and my skin hasn't looked better in years.I have noticed a slight improvement in the test stretch marks, but mostly because I wasn't too diligent with them.My process was:  wash my face with gentle cleanser and rinse with warm water.  I would roll in an asterisk shape (*) on the target area, up and down (or back/forth)about four times each.  I would follow with a good moisturizer - I used basicLubriderm Daily Moisture Lotion SPF 15 Moisturizer with Sunscreen, 13.5  Ouncemost often, but also usedHydroxatone Intensive Anti-Wrinkle Complex,Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum, Fragrance Free, 1.7-Fluid OuncesandAINHOA Whitess Caviar Renewal Serum, 1.05 Fluid Ounce.  Honestly, I think any good moisturizer works fine, whatever works for your skin.  It doesn't need to be expensive.  Pure coconut oil works great too!!Does it hurt?  No, not really.  It feels like you have a light sunburn for about 45 minutes after use.  During use, it didn't feel bad to me - on a scale of 1-10, 1 being no pain and 10 being the worst, I'd say a 2.  No more painful than plucking eyebrows.  I used it about once, maybe twice a week.  I cleaned it by running super hot water on it and splashing some rubbing alcohol on it before putting it away.  I always washed my face immediately before use.  I never had any rashes, breakouts or any other negative response.I didn't tell my husband that I was using what amounts to a rolling pin with needles in it on my face - he thinks I'm kooky enough already.  Besides, I wanted to see if he would notice a difference and he DID.  He asked if I had been drinking more water or using something different on my face because I look YOUNGER.  And no, he wasn't just flattering me, he was being totally honest, I promise.My final thoughts:  This worked for me, inexpensive, was low maintenance, easy to use and no poison injected in my skin.

  AFTER: This same hair dryer was for 38 bucks in my local shop. (Got it for 17 bucks from amazon) I was hyped when I saw it on amazon for such a cheap price, but was doubtful that it might be a piece of junk. But It was good. My friend, brother, sister and I use it. (Not too often) just when we are heading out to a party or something. It's really good, totally worth buying! :)

  AFTER: It's not just for use as a nutritional supplement!Castor Oil has natural antioxidant properties, and absorbed into the skin it helps to naturally minimize and prevent wrinkles as well as stretch-marks, and it even conditions hair when added in small amounts to shampoo or deep conditioner treatment!Tip: A little added Castor Oil and natural vitamin E to a base of Coconut Oil or Jojoba Oil (ratios about: 1 part vitamin e oil, to 10 parts coconut oil and -part to 1 part castor oil) combine to make for a great all-natural body oil with full-on anti-aging properties!If skin is very oily, use it to spot treat areas (under eye area, stretchmarks, dry patches, hands feet) overnight and rinse in the morning. If skin is very dry, then daily use,full-on for the entire face and body will leave your skin noticeably supple and smooth and o-so--soft! Apply full strength overnight to dry hands and feet (cover with cotton socks and cotton gloves).Overall, it is an outstanding product, whether used to enrich smoothies or used topically. And a little goes a long way for healthier skin and hair.Our grade: B ; or 4-Stars!

  AFTER: I was wondering when I used this one if the salt in it would dry out my skin and leave a film.  When I used it I was very happy that it did not dry out my skin at all.  It left me feeling nice and clean.  It did not leave a filmy residue at all.  The smell is just a nice clean smell that reminded me a little of a spa.  I even used this bar of soap on my face and it left it feeling clean and even a little tighter.  It did not irritate my dry spots or my oily spots at all.  I have used it for about a week now and the bar of soap it just like new.  This soap is going to last me for quite awhile.  The mineral products are fantastic and they are at a fantastic price.

  AFTER: This is the best mascara I have ever used in this price range.  I would recommend trying it!I'm so used to using mascara with huge brushes that make applying it more difficult that the little perfectly contoured brush that comes with this mascara was a real surprise.  It was perfect.  I don't know if my eyelashes have ever looked as long as they do with this mascara... And it adds above average volume too!

  AFTER: I preface this review by saying that I've been using night cream for years and have fairly good skin (except for the areas around my eyes).  That said, I'm not sure this cream is any better than Regenerist Nightly Moisturizer.  I switched over because of all of the hype but haven't noticed any real difference or improvement.  For those who are just starting a nightly moisturizer routine, this cream may be better than the less expensive Nightly Moisturizer.  But, I think I'll switch back.  Both products are excellent.

It has a smoky smell that i found kind of strange at first but it ok now and it the thickness of syrup which i kinda like since my hair is thick as well. Its the thickest oil Ive ever used. It moisturises my edges very well especially since its thick. I has new growth already

  AFTER: I love this polish. This shade is the perfect shade for my pale skin with pink undertones. And I find IBD better than CND. Well, some of my CND works very well, but some I find shrinks. This does not shrink at all.The only &#34;complaint&#34; I have isn't really a complaint, but is more to do with application and my learning curve. I applied the two color coats a little thicker on the first hand than the second and they look different. I wish I had noticed before I applied the top coat! Not sure if I can apply a color coat atop the cured top coat.I guess the good news is it's easy to apply thin coats to achieve different looks.Love this polish and color! Will purchase again and look forward to trying other IBD polishes.

  AFTER: I love all things purple and this color is perfect!  Actually my nails came out a tad lighter than the color in the picture on my computer and I would call the color a bit more lavender as I see a hint of gray in it.  I wear silver polish quite often and this lavender is just beautiful and goes with most everything.  A lot nicer than a really dark purple for me.  This is also my first from IBD and so far I'm a week into it and it's holding up equally well to gelish or some other brand... and it's cheaper - which means more colors that I can buy!

  AFTER: Is your hair thinning? Edges breaking off? Want thicker hair? This is the oil for you. One of my fellow natural hair bloggers recommended this product to me and I have not been disappointed. I do not have a problem with thin hair or breakage but I would to ensure that doesn't occur. I started using this product daily to apply to my hairline prior to smoothing it back. Since I've been using it, I've noticed that my hair all over is really thick and really strong. It has a nutty smell to it and a thick consistency. It smooths onto your hair very easily and is absorbed well.

  AFTER: I like to go into Sephora and look at makeup, so I don't normally buy this brand (as it isn't sold there). Nor do I have an Ulta near me. So I purchased this a few times when I see it other places. I love it! It really does give you Doll eyelashes. They are really pretty! There isn't much to be said for the volume as the consistency of the product is kinda thin. But, you could always layer it. I never have much luck with both volume and length (even from products that claim to do both). I have used Diorshow, Buxom, and Yves Saint Laurent mascara and this is right up there with them IMO. My only complaint is that I do get some flaking from it later in the day sometimes.

  AFTER: If you check my review of Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum, you will see that I truly believe that the combination of the two have helped to keep my sixty-four-year-old skin looking softer, less wrinkled and better than the skin of most women my age.I'm not conceited; I inherited my good skin from my mother.  I also have always hated to sit in the sun.  I do have sun damage but it's mostly on the rest of my body because it came from my swimming; not my lying in the sun without sun protection.  My lovely face was protected because I used to swim underwater so much!In a nutshell, I was a dubious purchaser of this Olay Regenerist line when it first came out and I wouldn't be without it, all these years later.  Oh, and as an aside, I wish my mother, who was a strong proponent of using moisturizer, had told me to put it on the Back of my neck, not just the front.  If she had, I wouldn't have to back out of rooms, as I do today.A note:  I'm still looking for the absolutely perfect moisturizer, forgetting that I'm wearing it.  During a recent special, I ordered a moisturizer that cost $89 a bottle.  I had some samples and after using them for nine days, I decided not to open it when if arrived because I think my Regenerist works far better. Have I learned my lesson?  You bet I have!

  AFTER: Due to Hypothyroidism, my skin is very dry and requires constant moisturizing.  My feet are always super dry and on the verge of cracking at the heels no matter what I do.  I stumbled upon the Castor oil after ordering the Jojoba oil and thought "Why not".  My cabinets are full of expensive products that never worked and eventually are thrown in the trash.  It seems that Castor oil has many uses so I thought it couldn't hurt to give this a try and the price was right.  My feet no longer have the super dry and tight feeling and the cracking has gone away.  I didn't realize how tight the skin on my feet felt and how much discomfort it was causing.  I have started using this on my arms where I have age spots due to my sun loving lifestyle.  I could swear that the smaller spots have almost disappeared and the larger spots seem to be fading. The jojoba oil is great for my hair, but didn't do anything for my feet so it really takes the heavier Castor oil to get the results.

It's not as lightweight as you might think (which is why I bought it).  It's really kind of bulky.  Also, the buttons are too easy to push and located right where you hold the thing, so I'm constantly turning the dryer off when I'm using it..... annoying.

  AFTER: I would recommend that everyone keep castor oil in their home just like you would band aids, or peroxide.  Castor oil is good for so many purposes. I use it for scars, stretch marks, wounds, eczema, dry skin, pimples, Pretty much any skin ailment.  I have heard it is also used internally if you are constipated, or are trying to induce your own labor.  I also use it when I am sunburnt, I would definitely recommend this product to anyone!!!! One of my &#34;must have&#34; products in my household. Read some Edgar Cayce novels, he has even more helpful reasons to use Castor oil!!

  AFTER: I was nervous to use this because I don't use bar soap. I haven't used one since I can remember. Well I love Adovia products. When I received the product and open the package it was undamaged. I couldn't help but to smell it. The smell was amazing and not to over powering but does have a very clean smell to it. The soap is smooth and lathers perfectly. Its very moisturizing and natural with dead sea minerals. Left me feeling moisturized all day. It didn't even leave my face or body feeling dry. After the shower it has a lingering fragrance which is great. I love smelling good after a shower like you have just got out not like you only washed with water. Its not overpowering either but just very fresh. Loved it made my skin soft to the touch!!!!

  AFTER: The descriptions claims to have a thickening formula and to "extend and add volume" to lashes.  This mascara did neither!  At first I thought maybe it had simply dried out or been sent to me used.  That wasn't the case...there was just not the kind of brush that carried enough mascara to make much of a difference in your lashes.  I really wanted to like this mascara because I've been looking for a good one for a while now...most of them have been better than this one.  I wouldn't recommend spending your hard earned money on NYX Doll Eye Mascara.

  AFTER: Love my Jamaican castor oil. This smells as bad as the one back home and has the thick consistency but it doesn't make my hair grow like the castor oil my mom used in my hair while growing up in Jamaica. AND ofcourse my husband hates the smell- but what can I do??

  AFTER: I'm a fan of Cover Girl products because they work well and aren't overly expensive.  This mascara doesn't disappoint - it goes on smoothly with the brush and doesn't clump on my lashes.  I like that it colors and defines my lashes without thickening them too much, since I'm a little too old to pull off a dramatic super-huge-eyelash look.This mascara stays on all day without flaking or ending up smeared under my eyes, and it washes off easily with soap and water or cold cream.My only complaint is the odd shape of the container.  It's small on one end and top heavy so it wants to fall over, and angled at the other end so it can't stand on that end either.  And it's too fat in diameter to fit in the openings of my makeup case.  I do like the bright green color, since that makes it easy to find in a purse.

  AFTER: Great product and is the best skin cream that competes easily with the higher cost brands.

  AFTER: I decided to try something new.  I just wanted to give Olay Regenerist a try.  You do feel like you are sculpting your face with this cream. I am 63 and at this age I know how important a moisturizer is.  I use it on my brow and jawline and around my eyelids and mouth.  I really like this cream, and I have tried more expensive creams which are not as good as this!  Give this a try, and see for yourself the creamy smooth results!

  AFTER: I'm glad I didn't pay a lot for this.  I went back to my old Wally World cheapie.  It didn't dry my thick hair any faster nor did it make it smoother.

  AFTER: I am surprised how much I like this Clump Crusher Mascara.  The brush is does not pick up a ton of mascara so you have to apply a couple of coats to make it stand out, but on the plus side you do NOT get clumps!  I find that this applies cleaner than most other mascaras I have tried and I find that with the price Amazon.com has (subscribe & Save with coupon) it is a very very inexpensive mascara that does a descent job.  I recommend giving it a shot.  It's a cheap risk!

The mascara product is very good quality for a great price, it does a very good job of thickening my sparse and thin lashes.  It does not get brittle and fall off or smear.  It does not smell or make eye irritating fumes.  Great product for a very reasonable price.

  AFTER: I have a real problem with raccoon eyes after hours of wearing mascara, even with powder under my eyes. Cover Girl has always been better than the rest. I used to use the orange one, now I'm hooked on this one. Goes on nicely even with one coat. Washes off easily with cleanser and water, which is important for me with my contact lenses.

  AFTER: I bought this item on April 18, 2013 and started using it immediately on fine lines on my face and a selected amount of stretch marks on my stomach.  A little over 6 weeks later, I'm writing a review to report my experience.LOVE!I mainly wanted to get rid of the "11"'s between my eyes.  I won't inject poison into my face so this was the next best option.  Many people report that it didn't work for them but I am reporting that it worked for me!  Are they gone?  No, that wouldn't be possible.  Those are muscles that have been trained over more than 3 decades of repeated facial movements.  In my case, I squinted a lot.  But....they DO look A LOT better.  They are not nearly as deep or noticeable.  I am very fair skinned, red hair, freckles so any blemish on my skin is obvious (to me anyway).Another area I tried was a small acne scar.  It is completely gone now.  It used to be a small dent in my face, sort of like a dimple.  There was a white "thing" in it that I would pick at.  It's gone too!The fine lines around my eyes are noticeably gone - seriously, I look like I am 5 years younger in that area. The lines around my mouth (nasolabial folds) are noticeably less pronounced.  This particular device isn't really suited to handle the lines around my lips.I had a brown spot on my cheek, it's completely gone now.  All over, my face looks brighter, smoother and my skin hasn't looked better in years.I have noticed a slight improvement in the test stretch marks, but mostly because I wasn't too diligent with them.My process was:  wash my face with gentle cleanser and rinse with warm water.  I would roll in an asterisk shape (*) on the target area, up and down (or back/forth)about four times each.  I would follow with a good moisturizer - I used basicLubriderm Daily Moisture Lotion SPF 15 Moisturizer with Sunscreen, 13.5  Ouncemost often, but also usedHydroxatone Intensive Anti-Wrinkle Complex,Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum, Fragrance Free, 1.7-Fluid OuncesandAINHOA Whitess Caviar Renewal Serum, 1.05 Fluid Ounce.  Honestly, I think any good moisturizer works fine, whatever works for your skin.  It doesn't need to be expensive.  Pure coconut oil works great too!!Does it hurt?  No, not really.  It feels like you have a light sunburn for about 45 minutes after use.  During use, it didn't feel bad to me - on a scale of 1-10, 1 being no pain and 10 being the worst, I'd say a 2.  No more painful than plucking eyebrows.  I used it about once, maybe twice a week.  I cleaned it by running super hot water on it and splashing some rubbing alcohol on it before putting it away.  I always washed my face immediately before use.  I never had any rashes, breakouts or any other negative response.I didn't tell my husband that I was using what amounts to a rolling pin with needles in it on my face - he thinks I'm kooky enough already.  Besides, I wanted to see if he would notice a difference and he DID.  He asked if I had been drinking more water or using something different on my face because I look YOUNGER.  And no, he wasn't just flattering me, he was being totally honest, I promise.My final thoughts:  This worked for me, inexpensive, was low maintenance, easy to use and no poison injected in my skin.

  AFTER: I preface this review by saying that I've been using night cream for years and have fairly good skin (except for the areas around my eyes).  That said, I'm not sure this cream is any better than Regenerist Nightly Moisturizer.  I switched over because of all of the hype but haven't noticed any real difference or improvement.  For those who are just starting a nightly moisturizer routine, this cream may be better than the less expensive Nightly Moisturizer.  But, I think I'll switch back.  Both products are excellent.

  AFTER: A hair dryer review by a bald guy is somewhat amusing.  I bought this for my wife who luckily is not bald.  The dryer is quieter than her last one which was supposed to be quiet and certainly wasn't.  Quietness is very subjective while this is quieter I don't see how all you haired folks stand that noise for the length of time it takes to dry your hair.  This does a good job.

  AFTER: It causes me pain, but I like it so far. It leaves my face red, but that means that it works. I&#8217;ve got it in perfect condition (some people here were complaining about it being broken) and so far I&#8217;m happy with it.It&#8217;s painful on some areas more than others (or that&#8217;s just with me), but I guess it depends on pressure as well; pushing it more into skin means more pain, but I might as well since I want to see the full results and take the full advantage of the device. I apply a lotion afterwards and my face is still a little red in the morning. I&#8217;ve noticed fewer scars in just a few weeks. I&#8217;ll see how it goes with this one as far as pain and maybe in a future get the 1.5mm&#8230;.but not yet.

  AFTER: I have used this night moisturizer for years and see no reason to switch to another product.  It seems to work well and is rich but not greasy.  It has never caused my  skin to break out either.  I have tried more pricey products in the past, but now basically stick with Olay night and day moisturizers and am pleased.

  AFTER: I love the smell and lather of this product. It will show signs of working after a few days and as everyone has a different skin tone and type this might not be for everyone and the results will not be the same. If your using this with another product that could cancel the effect as well.

UID: 23373

  AFTER: This was just an okay product to me. I did find that this product clumped (despite the name) and it really didn't lengthen or thicken. I use it for during the day when I don't have much makeup on. It gives my lashes some definition. But if you're looking for a product to use with heavier makeup or for going out, this isn't it.

  AFTER: I have been seeing this recommended on YouTube for hair growth for a pretty long time. I originally bought this about six months but only used it sparingly when I noticed my hair was dry. I never noticed the results everyone raved about so it took a backseat to my Dabur Vatika coconut oil. Recently, I have been doing my own hair (I was natural for 3 years and switched back to relaxers) which included amping up my regimen. I apply this black castor oil to my temples, outer edges, and ends of my hair. I lie to you not, just in the two weeks of me using it REGULARLY (I apply it every night and then wrap my hair) my hair is noticeably growing. My temples are extremely thin, partly hereditary and partly due to tension alopecia, and I have noticed parts that were bald and slick, now have fuzz and are filling out. Like I said, it's only been two weeks; imagine the results for YEARS! If your goal is hair growth I absolutely, positively, definitely recommend this for you.

  AFTER: Unpacked item, which I felt was well packaged, and sanitary.  It did not have elaborate instructions; basically a small paragraph on the side of the box, but that was fine.  The item did not appear cheap to me like others stated.  I mean&#8230;what do you expect for $10 anyhow?  It did seem smaller than expected, but no big deal.  I washed my face and rolled as directed, 10 rolls in each spot.  I bought this because of previous use with an acupuncture mat (aka Bed of Nails), gently puncturing yourself definitely increases blood flow and endorphin production.  So I can sort of see how this would stimulate collagen growth.  My face turned red, and felt like mild sunburn.  I did my hands and neck too.  I didn&#8217;t really notice anything but irritation at first.  Did my regular routine and went to bed.  This morning, there is no doubt it did something.  The lines around my mouth (I smoked for 17 yrs) are way less apparent, same with the lines on my forehead.  My left hand has tiny red dots, like broken blood vessels?  I may have pushed too hard, but I didn&#8217;t think I was when I was doing it.  My skin feels tight, but like that feeling you get from sunburn.  I don&#8217;t wear heavy makeup, or concealers.  I use a lot of moisturizers, especially Organic Coconut Oil on my fac, hair and body at night (anyone that never has tried coconut oil needs to go get some now!! I used Spectrum Organic Coconut Oil, you can get it at a local grocery store-more info check out my blogs [...] ) during the day I used a tinted SPF moisturizer, it&#8217;s very light.  My skin definitely has a glow today!  May just be irritation but whatever it is, it looks better, so I&#8217;m happy with that!  I think this thing works and honestly didn&#8217;t expect to notice such a difference after first use; I will use it again for sure!  I can see how people with sensitive skin would not like it.  I have a high pain tolerance, I also epilate and wax, so this isn&#8217;t that bad to me.  I&#8217;m hoping it reduces the size of the pores on my cheeks.  And I&#8217;m going to keep using it on my hands.  I&#8217;m glad I found this thing!  I will probably use at most, 1x a week because of how tight my skin feels.  Glad I didnt' go with 2mm yet.

  AFTER: This is the first gel polish I've tried, and so far I'm very satisfied with the results. I haven't made it past a week before the polish ships or peels, though. I'm sure it has something to do with the application process. The base coat seems to be thicker than the top coat, and from what I've read, it's important to apply thin layers. As I progress, I may purchase the mor expensive line of Harmony base coat to compare.I think this line is affordable for novice nail painters, who just want to paint their own nails, and not pay over $30 at the salon every two weeks. The gel bonder is a definite must have! Not to be confused with the PH bond stuff. Overall, I'm happy with the IBD brand of gel polish.

  AFTER: I stumbled across this item in a search for something else.  I decided to read up on it. Then I decided to try it.  I don't know if I can get past the pain of it.  I am not sure how hard I should be pressing, however, it is painful and the instructions say to go in a pattern that goes basically in every direction,  There is also discomfort afterwords a slight burning and then the next day itching. Not sure if I will get any results.  I just did a chemical peel a few weeks ago and now will use this again will update as I time goes on.

  AFTER: Thicker than Heritage however, very good product. Excellent moisturizer for both the skin and hair. As I said for Heritage castor oil, you can use this product as well for facial shaving.

  AFTER: I love this product for multiple reasons.  By background, I am an African American woman.  It really helps with hair growth as well as reducing shedding.  The only problem is that it's so thick, so I can only apply two days or so before I wash my hair.  Otherwise, it would weigh the hair down too much.  I also use it to moisturize my feet.  My feet are so soft and callus/shed free.  I would recommend this product to anyone.  I hear there are many uses and I just haven't implemented yet, but I will start using for other things as well.  Will definitely repurchase.

  AFTER: I used to love and swear by Aveeno but this winter the Aveeno lotion contributed to some sort of odd rash anywhere and everywhere I used the Aveeno. Each time I used the Aveeno the rash became worse and spread.. not good!While looking around for other lotions (this winter has been terribly dry!) I discovered the massage lotion that I prefer to use is actually less expensive per ounce than the Aveeno!  Once I realized my preferred massage lotion was actually less expensive and since I use these dispensers (Better Living Products Clear Choice Dispenser Three Chamber Shower Dispenser, White) for lotion anyway I realized I was better off purchasing the choice of professionals -Biotone Advanced Therapy Massage Lotion Gallon #ATL1G.  I now buy the massage lotion by the gallon to refill our lotion dispensers. The Biotone may SEEM more expensive but at the current prices it is in reality saving more than 40% per ounce AND is better on the environment since we are not discarding as many bottles over the lifetime of the product.

It is a solid smooth bar that is a decent size and has lasted me for over a week now. It doesn't leave any weird film or residue on my skin. It actually moistures my skin and makes it feel so smooth! It makes me feel clean after without drying out my skin. It does have a very light nice scent to it that is not overwhelming in any way. It lathers well.  On top of all of that, it's infused with 100% dead sea salts which benefits your skin. Makes me feel so luxurious using it. I would highly recommend!

  AFTER: Overall, I felt this nail polish was good quality for the price. However, it was not exactly what I expected for a few reasons:(1) COLOR - From looking at the photo of the bottle, I thought this polish would be pink.  However, the color is actually silver with just a slight pink/purple tint.(2) TRANSPARENCY - The polish much more transparent than I thought it would be.  Therefore, I had to put on 3-4 layers to get a nice thick layer of glitter.  However, if you are looking for something that does not overload the sparkles, this polish may be for you.

  AFTER: I received a free product to review for my blog, and I am never disappointed by Adovia.I have been using this soap all over for a few weeks now, and I have nothing but good to say about it. It cleans without stripping natural oils, and it keeps me from being all stinky- hey in Arizona you have to watch that in summer;)I love the light scent of this product, and all of Adovia's products really.. it is fresh and clean smelling without being overwhelming or too girly. Just the right scent.I am still using their shampoo and conditioner, so it is a great complement for all 3 together.Thanks again to Adovia for a great product!

  AFTER: Tried this twice already. Hurts like h***, but I'm going to keep on using. I'll get used to it & it's going to work a miracle on this tired old skin. I have faith in this roller. It's sitting on the bathroom counter, calling my name. As soon as I get up the nerve, I'm going to go use it. Try it, you might like it!

  AFTER: I get really dry skin, especially in the wintertime.  I'm sure you're excited and curious which parts of my body experience the dryness, right?  Well let me ease your delights!  Under my ears is the main spot.  In fact that's the main reason I bought skin cream to begin with.  Flakey, crusty skin that peels on my lobes, on both ears.  Skin also peels on the back of my ears.  It's sort of annoying.  Another popular spot is on the sides and back of my neck.  I will wake up and see balls of dry skin on my bed linen that will absolutely *have* to be shaken off.  This Aveeno lotion helps quite a bit.  Applying enough lotion around bedtime will ensure that by morning my skin will be healthy and improved. My lips also get crusty but I have chapstick to take care of that one.  My forehead and the tip of my nose are two other frequent skin-peeling locations.  Aveeno skin lotion will fix whatever's ailing your skin, guaranteed.

  AFTER: I have tried both the expensive and drugstore skincare products and convinced that Olay products gives you the same results as the cosmetic counter brands. This is a great moisturizer at a great value! I have very sensitive skin and use this as a night cream. It makes my skin look better and even toned after applying! I paired this with the regenerist cleanser and get superior results.

  AFTER: I was on a hunt for a peach gel polish. I was disappointed after purchasing the new Gelish Morning Dew color. Morning Dew was straight up Halloween orange. I don't know how they thought it was great for the new 2013 Spring launch. Anyway, this IBD color is great; pretty. I haven't found anything close to this color. Great color as an addition to my collection. IBD is one of my favorite gel brands that doesn't disappoint in consistency and in wear. I'll try to add a pic soon.

  AFTER: After I used the product, I went on Amazon's site to order the mascara for my daughter and some friends.  I was more than pleasantly surprised that if I purchased it through Amazon, the price was ultra reasonable at $6.00+.  I have used all types of mascaras and for the money, this is really worth it.  I have tried it for a few days, and it does NOT clump or smear below or above my eyes.  I cannot tell you how many expensive mascaras I have used only to be told, "you have some black stuff on your face and in your eyebrows! " Since my eyes tear, I expected some runny marks, but there were none.  The mascara separates the lashes but it does not add volume, so don't expect a fuller lash look.I must admit I was skeptical because of the packaging.  It comes in the hard-to-open bubble wrap, or whatever it is called, which takes a scissors and patience to open. It cheapens the product.  The casing is also tinny;  Covergirl did not put the money into the quality of the tube but I like the green color, I will always find it in my purse!  The wand can be used for different strokes to apply or replenish the product.  For the money, Covergirl is providing the consumer with a quality cosmetic.

  AFTER: I liked the base coat better than the top coat I purchased from the same brand. The brush is shorter than a standard nail polish brush which I found helpful and more accurate. You don't need more than a thin layer of a base coat and it was a great price. Similar to the top coat by IBD it says to cure for 30 seconds using an LED lamp. It took almost 3 minutes to cure the base coat using my LED lamp

  AFTER: I received this product for free in exchange for an honest opinion.I love the scent! It smells nice and clean. It lathered well, rinsed off clean and didn't make my face red or shiny. It didn't leave any residue behind. My skin was soft and smooth after using the Adovia Moisturizing Mineral Soap. I will keep using this mineral soap.

  AFTER: I know that so many women like that very famous brand of mascara that comes in the pink tube but I was never a fan. I hate, hate, hate mascara that clumps and leaves lashes feeling sticky or gummy and that particular brand always left my lashes feeling that way. I never understood they hype.Recently, my favorite mascara has been Cover Girl Lash Blast Volume (in the orange tube) but after trying this new Clump Crusher Mascara I now have a new favorite!I tend to get a lot of compliments on my eyelashes. They are very long and pretty lush.  A lot of times people think I am wearing false eyelashes when all I have on is mascara.  Still, this does present a problem.  Most mascaras will leave my eyelashes feeling heavy and gummy and sticky.  Cover Girl Clump Crusher Mascara completely avoids those bad feelings.  My eye lashes were nicely defined, darkened, and just thick enough.  The look is very natural but still dramatic enough to see a difference.  I also liked the fact that my lashes felt soft and supple - not stiff or sticky.  This mascara also is great at resisting smudging and smearing and doesn't flake. I was able to apply multiple layers of this product and it truly did not clump.  My lashes stayed define and did not bind together.  In short, the product works just as it promises.The tube is thick and chubby so it feels a little different in your hand.  It does take some getting use to but the product is still easy to apply.I think you will like this product.

  AFTER: This is my second favorite mascara after max factor 2000.  As the product says, you get no clumps, and I like the fact that it comes in brown shades.  While this lasts on your eyes longer than max factor, it's not as build-able, so you get less dramatic eyelashes.  If you are just looking for a little emphasis and no-fuss mascara (for work for example), but don't need super big lashes, this would be a good product for you.

  AFTER: Purchased this based on other reviews here.  Followed YouTube instructions and also read tips from reviewers here.  1st time I tried it, it was so painful had to stop.  So purchased numming cream which made it more bearable 2nd time.  It just seem to tear up my skin.  My acne scar actually became worse.  Would not recommend this.

  AFTER: This mascara is in an easy to see, green container. The product does not clump as stated from my several days of wearing this. It goes on really well, not too thick or thin. The brush does a good job of getting my lashes evenly coated. The one flaw is that after a few hours of wear, if I accidentally touch my lashes, the black mascara starts to flake off my lashes. I'm not talking about rubbing my eyes or anything fierce, but just touching my lashes -- black flakes. It's not horrendous, mind you, but still annoying as I expect my mascara to stay on even if I touch my eyes a little bit.  But still, I do like that it doesn't clump, looks greats on my eyes, and is in a cute little green container (as opposed to a black one which is hard to find in my makeup bag).

  AFTER: Is your hair thinning? Edges breaking off? Want thicker hair? This is the oil for you. One of my fellow natural hair bloggers recommended this product to me and I have not been disappointed. I do not have a problem with thin hair or breakage but I would to ensure that doesn't occur. I started using this product daily to apply to my hairline prior to smoothing it back. Since I've been using it, I've noticed that my hair all over is really thick and really strong. It has a nutty smell to it and a thick consistency. It smooths onto your hair very easily and is absorbed well.

  AFTER: I bought this product because of the wonders I hear it does for your hair. I have to agree, however, I won't know for sure until I straighten my curly hair out. I was looking for a product that grows and thinkens hair and this JBCO has appeared to deliver. I have also used it on my eyelashes (careful with that though, it can get into your eyes) and seen them grow and on my dry skin and seen it glow (this is best for dry skin, my skin is combo so I can't use it too much on my face, only when necessary). I'm sure there are many wonders untold about this oil, I am still looking.

  AFTER: Right away when I took it out of the package you can smell such a wonderful scent. It's hard to describe but it was quite strong but not overbearing to where I didn't want to smell it. I actually kept it on my desk for a day and it was pleasant to catch whiffs of it before I used it.I took it in the shower and I loved the smell. The feeling of the soap bar on my skin was nice. There is just always something nice about a product that has minimal chemicals in it. I felt like it didn't leave that nasty soapy residue a bunch of cheap soap bars leave on your skin. I have to constantly apply deodorant throughout the day. I don't have a sweating problem but I my underarm sweat smells a bit. I have tried clinical strength deodorants but they barely work. I have been washing my underarms with this soap and I swear it helps out a TON. I have noticed my underarms don't smell that bad anymore. You know what would be awesome? I could only hope that Adovia comes out with their very own deodorant because I think it would be a big success. I totally recommend this dead sea salt soap bar because it moisturizes your skin. It makes you feel good after using it. I prefer to use this on my body and I also use the dead sea mud soap for my face especially. I think having both bars of soap have been quite beneficial to my skin's health. The benefits of dead sea salt are too great for anyone not to consider adding it to their daily skin care regiment.

  AFTER: It was time to try a new mascara, because the "lengthening formula"  I'd been using ( L'Oreal Telescopic Lengthening Mascara)  clumped terribly, almost gluing my lashes together. (Uni-lash is not a good look!)I'm so glad I tried Covergirl Clump Crusher Mascara. I LOVE it, because it adds a ton of lush, natural looking volume, has an intense black color, and it DOES NOT CLUMP.It also stays on all day without smudging, and is very easy to remove  ( I use a basic foaming face-wash product which is safe for use around the eyes).I'll purchase this product again, because it is the only mascara I've tried that is truly clump-free.

  AFTER: I used this in a homemade hot oil treatment along with Coconut oil, sweet almond and jojoba. There was a noticible difference between not using this in the concoction and using it. When I mixed this with the rest of the oils, I noticed it was definitely thicker and stickier. I left it on overnight under a cap and rinsed it out the next morning. Not only was my hair softer, but the texture changed! Instead of frizzy curls, my curly hair was silky smooth. After these results, I wish I could use this everynight.. I'd never have a bad hair day again. I love this oil and the positive effects it has on my hair.

  AFTER: I will never buy this brand again.  I recommend Perfect Match by Lechat Nails.  This was my first time to do gel polish at home.  I did the Lechat on my mom and it was beautiful!!! Perfect, in fact.  Was so excited to do mine with the Viking Winter by Just Gel Polish.  It was terrible.  It shrinks when you put in under the UV.  I did it over and over again and it kept shrinking!  Left bubbles and dents all over.  Lets just say it took bruising my nails to get it off and I hadn't even put the top coat on, yet.  Don't waste your time or money.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!

  AFTER: I just got this.  I've used it twice, so I can't really give a "review" of the product's performace or efficacy, but I can comment on the "smell" or odor that people complain about.THERE IS NO ODOR!  It's castor oil for pete's sake!  It's smells like castor oil.No big deal.  Once you put it on your scalp or hair, you can't even smell it.And the texture of this oil is not "heavy" either.This brand is "lighter" than the castor oils I've used in the past.  It dissolves quickly.I will add to this review at a later date if and when I get results, if any.Edit:01-14-12Observations:  WHY is this product called "black"?  This castor oil is CLEAR, like all other castor oils.

  AFTER: This oil is great for thinning areas along the hairline, and promoting softer and longer hair. It takes a little while to see results, but its worth the wait. I massage this stuff on my scalp every night and notice that my hair is thicker and softer after 2 months of use. It may be a little thick for some, but a good solution would be to mix it with another oil like coconut or jojoba.

  AFTER: I love this soap and I love the scent.  One thing I look for in a soap is that it doesn't leave your skin feeling dry afterwards. This salt leaves my skin feeling moisturized, smelling great and the dead sea salt works as a good skin cleanser.  I would reccomend using this soap with the salts for an even better effect!

  AFTER: Overall, I felt this nail polish was good quality for the price. However, it was not exactly what I expected for a few reasons:(1) COLOR - From looking at the photo of the bottle, I thought this polish would be pink.  However, the color is actually silver with just a slight pink/purple tint.(2) TRANSPARENCY - The polish much more transparent than I thought it would be.  Therefore, I had to put on 3-4 layers to get a nice thick layer of glitter.  However, if you are looking for something that does not overload the sparkles, this polish may be for you.

  AFTER: I am 37 and starting to get those fine laugh lines and "crows feet".  I decided to give this a whirl.  While I like the unscented version better, the scented is still nice and not offensive; I have gotten creams in the past which are just too offensive and give me a headache.  My husband had commented on the earlier creams and for this one he hasn't said a word! (Not to mention the earlier ones did not work though I cannot remember, for the life of me, what they were; obviously I was not impressed.)The scented version has a light, non-offensive odor.  The unscented version has no odor (imagine that).  Regardless, they both do reduce fine lines!I was using it for about a week (8 days maybe?) before I saw a difference.  My fine lines were finer and less noticable.  (Probably no one but I noticed them before I started using this but it made me feel better and that is the point, isn't it?)And, when I got them, the exfoliating face-wash was being sold with it for half off.  And that is also a great product.I recommend this for anyone with light crease lines and who wants to keep their skin rejuvenated! I also highly recommend that you use the Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub Face Wash, as aforementioned.  I will also review that!

  AFTER: This light weight dryer dries my hair quickly without frying it due to the Warm setting on high.  I've been buying Tourmaline / Ionic dryers for years and would not consider buying any other.  It's quieter than my other dryers too.  I like the defuser for days when I want to go with my natural curly look without having to wait for it to air dry.  It's a steal on Amazon compared to my $100 dryers that do the same thing.  I was intending on leaving this one at my son's home when I visit him, but after using it I brought it back home with me and will leave another of my high priced dryers there the next time I visit.

  AFTER: I bought this mascara because it was rated the number one selling mascara according to Amazon. Well, it's not bad the first week but unremarkable. It's just like any other Mascara out there but the main problem is that it dries up very fast and you can only apply one coat. It dries on lashes in seconds and applying another coat doesn't do anything. I'm still on a quest for the best mascara and so far it's Falsies by believe it or not by Maybelline. I have no problem with spending $30.00 for a Mascara so this is not a $ issue. I've tried many of them. Difinicils used to be my favorite but I think since they've gotten so popular they cheapened the formula and give you less to make even more money. It's not the same. I'm still looking and it's not because I have short lashes, I have fairly long lashes but I want them to look even longer and thicker of course. I'm still on the hunt.

I looked horrible!  My entire face was flaky; forehead, chin, eyebrow areas.  I looked like a monster.  I read on WebMd that the active ingredient in this lotion is actually what helps heal dry skin so I gave it a shot.  That was almost 3 years ago.  I use this all over my body, but even more so I use it on my face because that is the only place I have a problem with dry skin, especially in the winter.  Target sells this size bottle for $10.99+ (and on numerous occasions it has been out of stock)but with Amazon's super saver subscription I get it delivered on time every 2 months for a cheaper price.

  AFTER: I will freely admit that i am a bit obsessed with soaps and bath products. I love trying different scents and brands and probably have enough body wash to last a lifetime (ok so that may be a bit of an overstatement bit I do have alot). My general preference isn't usually bar soap but was kindly sent this soap to test out so I figured it was worth a try.This is the Adovia Moisturizing Mineral Soap.This is a face/body soap containing a combination of Dead Sea minerals and trace elements derived from Dead Sea Salt.The smell is an extremely pleasant and fresh scent. Not to mild and not to overpowering either. Just the perfect amount of perfume.It's very moisturizing and lathers well. Leaves you clean and smooth without stripping away to many of your skins natural oils. I also really enjoyed that it didn't leave any of that funky filmy residue that so many soaps do.It's a fairly good size but at $11 a bar I suggest you not use it as your main soap.... especially if you live with multiple people.Overall I give it an 8/10. I throughly enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone seeking a nourishing and effective soap!I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free usingTomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.

  AFTER: I've tried the plastic brushes before and didn't like them.  For some reason this one is different.  Easy to use and get to those lashes in the corner.Depending on what you want will make or break this review.  I was using the 'Falsies' and was happy with the product, but this one was a bit different.  Doesn't seem to add a lot of length, but it does separate quite well and I'm finding I like the look.  I do use 3-4 applications while it's still wet and it gives a bit of a spikey look.I also find it does not wash off easily, but that could be my choice in removers.I will, at least for a while, be using this product again.Thank you.MEF

  AFTER: This is 100% castor oil.  SUPER thick and sticky but it leaves your hair feeling so soft and touchable...its amazing.  I add this oil to shea butter for my hair creams and it whips to perfection.  I also used it alone after cowashing and my hair was sooooo soft.  It is VERY thick so be careful.  I noticed a big difference in the softness and strength of my hair when I used this product alone.

  AFTER: I have short eyelashes, so when I apply mascara, usually they clump up. This one is really a clump crusher. My favorite mascara before was from BareMinerals because my eyelashes looked natural but fuller with it. However, it was $20 for a small one. This one also does the same but I pay less! I totally love this one, plus the color of the barrel is green which is easy to see when it's in my purse.

  AFTER: First: STRONG scent. I am sensitive to scents and I didn't like how this smells. This makes me use the product less.The texture is very thick but moisturizing. I use it to massage my scalp and it leaves it very oily but it feels nice after washing it off with shampoo.

  AFTER: This is a quality polish that goes on smooth and cures to a hard shine that lasts without chipping. The color isn't as deep as I thought it was going to be - I was expecting a deep sparkling pewter, instead it's a sparkling chrome - still very pretty though

  AFTER: Seriously doubt the claims that it is Tourmaline, Ionic and Ceramic.  There is not switch for Ionic (as described) and the nozzle is at sort of an odd angle from the handle, not 90 degrees like most hairdryers.  The photo makes it look as if it is but it's more like 80 degrees, which makes awkward to direct it at your hair in some positions when using a round brush.  Dosen't seem to dry any faster than a non-specialized dryer.  Not my favorite.

  AFTER: Thicker than Heritage however, very good product. Excellent moisturizer for both the skin and hair. As I said for Heritage castor oil, you can use this product as well for facial shaving. Seems mildly richer than the Heritage product but, they are bothvery good for whatever your needs in that category.

  AFTER: This works so well to control and fix my calluses on my feet and ankles.  It's the only thing I've found that works on taking care of the stubborn, tough, dry skin on my feet.  I just rub some into the skin and then put on a pair of heavy socks.  My skin is vastly improved in the morning.

  AFTER: To start, I am a huge fan of bar soaps. I love how little packaging they have in comparison to liquid soaps, and I also love that what packaging they do have is usually a box which is biodegradable. I'm all about reducing my waste so I don't have to worry about reusing or recycling much, and bar soaps help with that goal.So I'm going in expecting to be pleased, and I was overwhelmed! This is hands-down the most moisturizing bar soap I have ever tried, and I've used absolutely wonderful, hand-made, cold-processed goat's milk soaps. Don't expect this soap to rinse squeaky clean - it leaves a slight film of something softening on your skin that soaks right in as soon as it's dried. You don't feel anything but smooth, supple skin after you wash with this. I can definitely skip moisturizer on my face when I use it to wash away the day, and I don't find my hands drying out nearly as much as they do with normal bar soaps - or even other good ones.It's also a hefty, solid bar that's incredibly long-lasting. Most of the really moisturizing bar soaps I've tried have melted away quite easily, especially if left in damp places (like the shower). This one just keeps going and going...I've used it multiple times a day for nearly two weeks straight now, and you'd hardly be able to tell by looking at it - the logo has barely worn smooth.About the only thing that approaches a negative for me is the scent. It's very reminiscent of &#34;old lady perfume&#34; smells to me - that really heavy, heady floral-type fragrance. It's incredibly strong in this soap, so much so that it constantly fills the room with the scent, even when you aren't using it. Fortunately, though, it doesn't linger much on the skin, so I don't wind up smelling it all day long. Thanks to that, I really don't have much of a complaint about the smell.Honestly, it's hard to say anything bad about this product - I absolutely love it, the price is reasonable, and I'm definitely prepared to order more!

  AFTER: I was really surprise because My wrinkles in my forehead was almost gone and my acne scar but it take more then 2weeks to see the result.  It was hurt when I roll them in my face because have a thin skin but I put in my mind that I'm going to be beautiful so this is just nothing ^^ I would recommend for you guys this and after I roll this thing I put some natural oil like vitamin E oil or olive oil on this.

  AFTER: I have been using this for over six months and I can see subtle differences. For point of reference, my fair, normal skin has been described by a recent aesthetician as "remarkably unlined" skin. This comment wasn't even qualified with a "for your age" which is over 40. I've taken really good care of my skin since about age 13. That, combined with the inability to tan, has laid a good foundation. This is to say, I don't have problems that I'm trying to correct, only prevent. I have noticed improvement on my neck, where I am beginning to get some creases, and also with the crows feet from smiling that were starting to form. Since I have no plans to quite smiling it was nice to see those results.As to the pain of it, I would say that you get used to the slight sting and it's worth it for the results. Make sure to roll slowly or you will make it more painful and risk breaking your skin. Slow and steady is the trick. I use it on my neck, too, where the skin is thin and while I wouldn't say it tickles it's also not cringe-worthy pain either.My routine is this: Every evening after my skin is clean I put on a good moisturizer on my face and neck. I spray the roller, which has been thoroughly washed after the previous use, with rubbing alchohol. I run the roller, GENTLY, multiple times in each direction using short strokes beginning at my forehead and working my way down to eyes, cheeks, smile brackets, and finishing at the neck. I finish off with a more emollient night cream. I live in Arizona where it's quite dry so this last step is due to that fact and not a requirement. Other than the addition of the roller I have not altered my skin care regimen. I do not use astringents because I don't need it and find it drying. I certainly would not spray my skin with rubbing alcohol. I have not changed my skin care regimen except to introduce the micro needle roller.After each and every use, be sure to thoroughly clean the roller per the instructions. This really amounts to running it under hot water which I do after use, not before. This is per the instructions included with the roller. I have my water heater set very high so I know the water is scalding hot. I run it under a gentle stream. After letting it air dry a few minutes I spray it a second time with rubbing alcohol before putting it in its holder to dry. I also leave the lid slightly askew to let air in. The times I've put the lid on tight I've noticed condensation and I don't want it to rust.I found good instructions (both for use and for cleaning up afterward) on YouTube to augment those coming with the roller. It is imperative that you don't share the roller. The instructions say this but please don't ignore that.I would recommend this product based on my experience. In fact, I got my mother one.

  AFTER: I keep coming back and buying this stuff because it really works for me year round.  This product helps so much with my dry skin.  I used to use something like this just in the winter time when my sking became so dry.  As I have aged that dry skin problem is now a year round problem.  This product does not leave me feeling greasy as some of these type products do.  It is clean smelling and keeps the dry skin away.  Aveeno makes a good product.  I now subscribe to buying this so that I don't run out.  Recommend to buy.

  AFTER: I liked the base coat better than the top coat I purchased from the same brand. The brush is shorter than a standard nail polish brush which I found helpful and more accurate. You don't need more than a thin layer of a base coat and it was a great price. Similar to the top coat by IBD it says to cure for 30 seconds using an LED lamp. It took almost 3 minutes to cure the base coat using my LED lamp

  AFTER: I have fallen in love with a different brand of body soaps that are paraben free.  Before, I was a loyal fan of Aveeno.  Nothing wrong with the product, just that it has parabens (nothing toxic), but not as natural as some of the other soaps that I have discovered.  I love the scent, and how it feels on the skin after each use.  It a great product, but I have found betters ones recently.

  AFTER: I'm a fan of Cover Girl products because they work well and aren't overly expensive.  This mascara doesn't disappoint - it goes on smoothly with the brush and doesn't clump on my lashes.  I like that it colors and defines my lashes without thickening them too much, since I'm a little too old to pull off a dramatic super-huge-eyelash look.This mascara stays on all day without flaking or ending up smeared under my eyes, and it washes off easily with soap and water or cold cream.My only complaint is the odd shape of the container.  It's small on one end and top heavy so it wants to fall over, and angled at the other end so it can't stand on that end either.  And it's too fat in diameter to fit in the openings of my makeup case.  I do like the bright green color, since that makes it easy to find in a purse.

  AFTER: I admit it.  I was really skeptical about this crazy thing.  Now, I can't live without it.  It is a little pinchy on the skin when you roll it, (sometimes it makesme sneeze when I do between the brow area)  but it opens up my pores and lets the product absorb down into the skin so effectively!!  My skin is luminous when I go to bed and refreshed in the morning when I awake.  I love it, It is of good quality and the price was FANTASTIC! I am hooked.  Thank you to the seller for the fantastic price, and the super fast delivery.

  AFTER: I use castor oil in conjunction with EVOO for the Oil Cleansing Method. Castor Oil is good for drawing out impurities in the skin, and when I felt a sebum plug in my hand, I was sold! I don't know if I plan to use it in my hair, but I definitely will continue to use it on my skin! It's a great oil, although it's very drying. This particular brand of Castor Oil is a great value, and 16 oz will last you a long time!

When I received the product and open the package it was undamaged. I couldn't help but to smell it. The smell was amazing and not to over powering but does have a very clean smell to it. The soap is smooth and lathers perfectly. Its very moisturizing and natural with dead sea minerals. Left me feeling moisturized all day. It didn't even leave my face or body feeling dry. After the shower it has a lingering fragrance which is great. I love smelling good after a shower like you have just got out not like you only washed with water. Its not overpowering either but just very fresh. Loved it made my skin soft to the touch!!!!

  AFTER: I have used this hair dryer about 10 times so far and I have to say.  It is an amazing bang for your buck!  I mainly got it as a back up dryer and then began my search for a high quality dryer in the $80-$100 price range.  I tried Solia 1875 ionic and the Rusk Speed Freak so far and both of them paled in comparison to this one.  It only has two heat settings but the high heat is perfect (not too hot, but not warm either).  This dryer is tourmaline & ceramic and I found i had more body and the same amount of shine with this one as I did with the Solia but the Solia made my hair very flat.  Not so with this dryer.  My hair has great body and doesn't get stringy or greasy the next day.  THe Rusk dried my hair to shreds (can you say horse hair???) and caused a lot of breakage.  I am sending both the high priced dryers back whence they came and keeping this one and will buy a 2nd one as a backup and I still saved about 50%!  Thanks Revlon & Thanks Amazon!  :)Update:  I still like this product but it didn't really calm my damaged broken bangs.  It left them frizzy and I think was contributing to the damage.  Every time I dried my hair my broken bangs would fly all over the place and stick up horribly.  I ended up buying a Babyliss 6600 dryer from Amazon and will use this as a backup.  It is very lightweight but I dont think it will hold up well.  Stick to Babyliss (more money but worth it if you have damaged, fragile hair).

  AFTER: I opened my package from Amazon. I was taken back by the great smell right away. I literally smelt the box of soap for 5 minutes. It has a very fresh aroma. The soap is great, it exfoliated the skin, as well it doesn't leave any residue behind. I would give this 7 stars if i could.

  AFTER: I usually use this product after I wash my face and before i apply my face products. I roll for a total of 5 minutes around my whole face and I can tell this product works because my skin is brighter the next morning. This product does what it claims. Because it pierces my pores, my skin is able to absorb my skincare products better. Within the past 2 years, ive had bad acne and i FINALLY got it under control but i had so many acne scars that made me want to hide in my house 24/7. I came across this product and began to use it for about 3 weeks and within those 3 weeks, my acne scars were the size of the ball of a ball point pen. Even though it was quite painful, I started to get comfortable using it after the first few days. But within those 3 weeks, I used this product every night after washing my face. Believe in me when i say this product works wonders but you have to be patient and use it for at least 5-10 minutes every night. Good LUcK

I used to have those tiny bumps on the upper backs of my arms that drove me crazy but no more, not since I began using this lotion and the soap.  The price on Amazon is the best since I've seen it for up to $11.50 at the stores.  There is always an extra bottle under my cabinet.  Have also recommended it to many friends who swear by it as well once they began using it and enjoying the results.

  AFTER: Now Foods does not specify if this castor oil is refined or unrefined, but it is certainly specified as Hexane free and expeller pressed, not cold pressed but in conventional form not organic or USDA organic form. Priced extremely reasonably, it is a good start but with new technologies, I found USDA organic with certification and unfiltered which makes it more expensive but certainly a better choice for me.CO is the most important oil out of handful of oils that I daily as beauty mix. I just put half the amount of shampoo, rub it in my palm to mix the shampoo and the CO, apply it as shampoo every single time. I place some CO directly on my head, scrub the scalp for removal of any residue on hair. Ricinoleic acid in castor oil helps to protect hair and stimulates circulation of nutrient rich blood to scalp. Dry scalp can lead to dandruff but CO's omega-9 fatty acids can help. I leave it for few hours and then wash it off. I place CO directly on my eye brows for hair growth. I mix with VCO since it keeps the mix not only liquid but runny. It is the best mix after shaving. I apply the mix to my whole body before mountain biking without any shirt or pumping iron at the gym. The mix keeps the bees and flies away.  I mix CO with AO to remove dark spots on my skin because of the scabs that I get from mountain biking. I blend CO with few more ingredients to make scrub, shaving cream and sunscreen.Any oil from any nut, seed or grain will go rancid, having no nutritional value shortly after production so I keep all my oils in dark containers, away from any light, air and moisture and use it quickly.

  AFTER: Well, if you say this roller doesn't hurt, you are kidding yourself. It does hurt, a lot too. However, this is when you apply pressure. But, if you keep it within the same area, the pain lessens. I was excited to receive this based on other reviews and my own personal research. I have since used the product about five times. At first, I used it a couple of times every other day, then I started waiting a week in between rolling. Your face does feel like you got a sunburn afterwards. Some people say it goes away within an hour, for me, it takes at least a day. After 24 hours, my skin looks plumped up. Although, it appears to get back to normal after three days (or two). I think it's working, but I can't be 100% sure. My skin seems to look better than it did when I first used it. I'm going to keep working with this. I have tried many other ways to boost collagen, so as long as I follow instructions, I don't see how it can hurt.

  AFTER: I had ordered this product mainly because i just needed a hair dryer. I was tempted by its price and the brand. I have not used Revlon before, but i took chance just because of its name in the market. People who are not willing to pay a lot for expensive brands like Sedu and Babybliss, can opt for this one as it is cheap and good for daily use. Also, it has two attachments, one being concentrated drying and other, finger diffuser. Additionally, it has cold air and hot air switching control for your comfort. If you are not finicky about the styling of hair and are just concerned with drying, this is the product for you! The delivery was at my door, so what more can i say about it.i would highly recommend this product to everyone.

A little about myself: I'm 40 and have recently (intentionally) lost over 30 pounds, have had a stressful last six months, and have an expressive face (I wrinkle my eyebrows a lot). So I started to notice creases above my eyebrows.  Stress, weight loss, and my continued eye wrinkling started to show. Ugh.  I can't afford medical intervention, but knew that I needed to do something. Just like everyone else ... I had seen the Olay commercials. I'm a natural born skeptic and hate to waste money.  $20-- ok, worth a try.I used the cream (light, non greasy, lovely) one night before bed. The forehead creases are noticeably diminished after only one day's use. I looked more rested and fresh faced.  I was completely surprised. I am anxious to see what a week's worth of use will do.

  AFTER: Many soaps are drying and harsh for all over use. If you ever seen those commercials of the residue left behind, and those soaps could actually be ruining your skin than it's time for a change. Thanks to Adovia Mineral Skin Care for bringing us the  Moisturizing Mineral Soap with Dead Sea Salt and Minerals, that can be used all over and is great  for hydrating our skin and not drying it out!The Dead Sea is actually been known to do wonders for the body and now you may notice it in many products from hair care to skin care. The reason for using the Dead Sea is because the salts contain well over 21 minerals that are key to keeping our skin healthy. The Dead Sea Salts can benefit every skin issue and reverse the effects!Here is a list of many benefits of using a soap with Dead Sea Salts:Effective in cleaning and exfoliating the skin as compared to most soap products.Rids of toxins from the skin and helps in good blood circulation.Rid of dead skin cells, cleans skin pores and helps in skin regeneration.Firm up skin tissues and strengthens these against infections.Eliminate aches and body pains, making the body more relaxed.Treating skin ailments such as eczema and psoriasis and lessens inflammation of dry skin.Relieve muscle tension, lessens stress and anxiety.So when offered a bar of soap that cleans and feeds nutrients into the skin, than I'd buy it! Plus the price is great for something that can be used all over, face and body. It does have a lovely strong smell and soothing feel when applied to the skin. It looks like a regular soap bar, but acts almost like a lotion. It adds a smoothness on your skin, after your done showering. It feels great and can be used often!This is probably something that a dermatologist would recommend safe for those with eczema and other skin issues. For me, in the past I use to have horrible dry/eczema skin. It would be so itchy and I look like a crocodile( imagine an avocado skin), not pleasant!  However, once in awhile I still get very dry skin during the summer and this soap actually is moisturizing enough that if my dermatologist told me in the past that I should try using Dead Sea Salt Soap than maybe I wouldn't of had such dry skin!I think this is a wonderful product, great for the face and skin. I would recommend this to anyone who has skin issuesI can definitely tell you that my skin has improved a whole lot since I've used the Moisturizing Mineral Soap.

  AFTER: I have tried just about everything- and I mean EVERYTHING (I worked in skincare for several years and was able to try hundreds of products for free)- and this is the one and only thing that 1) made any difference whatsoever on my pitted acne scarring (and a big difference at that)2) kept me from breaking out ONCE regardless of time of month or what I used on my face3) refined large pores and evened tone on my faceI couldn't believe how much it turned my skin around. I had redness, uneven tone, pitted scars and at least five or six blemishes at all times and after day two of using it, I had far less blemishes and less redness. By week two I had less scarring, smaller pores and no blemishes whatsoever. I have to say I've had NO issues with the quality of the product and I've used it every single day for two months. It still rolls just as well as it did the first time and it doesn't snag on skin at all. Works like new for me! The person who had problems with it probably just got a defective one, but neither of the two I've ordered have given me or my husband any problems.

  AFTER: I use this on my face for acne (which has really worked) as well as replacing my moisturizer and on my hair for softness (which has also worked.) I've been using on my face everyday for two weeks and my hair 1-2 times per week during that span. It looks like hardly any is missing from the bottle--so a little bit goes a LONG way! For the price offered here, you really can't go wrong. I imagine this will last at least 3-4 months.

I was using 3 other different lotions, I even soaked my hand in lotion!..Nothing seemed to help, so i took to the net to look for something that would give me some relief,after reading several product reviews i decided to give Aveeno a try, i put it on in the store to make sure it didn't burn like a few others,and i noticed a softness right away, Last night before bed i put some on, and i am SHOCKED at my results, almost all the redness is gone, i washed my hands this morning and no burn..even the rough parts are gone..my only regret?..not buying a bigger bottle!

  AFTER: Got it in the mail yesterday and put it to work last night. Reviewers who said it was painful were not joking. I have a high pain tolerance but man, that thing HURTS. I was really fighting back those tears! I also had to take mini-breaks.I tried not to add any pressure but then the wheel wouldn't spin and the needles ended up scratching my face. Imagine rubbing a cactus on your face. OUCH!! So I put just enough pressure to get the roller going and it kept squeaking big time. Did not sound good. I wished the roller was better lubricated so I wouldn't have to use ANY pressure. Then it wouldn't have been so bad. Maybe that's why some people are saying it didn't hurt?My face got red and warm,just like a sun-burn. I was kind of scared at first because I read (afterwards) that it can cause melasma and hyperpigmentation to darken. I was hoping to LIGHTEN melasma/hyperpigmentation, some very fine lines and very few acne scars. Next time I 'll go a lot easier on the pigmented areas and focus more on the lines and scars. Hopefully I can stir up enough courage to do this again in a couple of weeks.Woke up this morning and my face felt soft but dry and warm. It was still red and felt like a sun-burn. Put on all natural moisturizing/repair serums and sunscreen after my morning shower. Up close my face still looked painful but from a distance I had a really nice "sun-kissed glow." It was quite pretty. Like I was wearing a really pretty blush.Well that's all I can say about this roller for now. Hopefully once my face heels fully, I'll see and feel a little more improvement.

  AFTER: My mom has type 4b or c or z hair, whatever you want to call it.  If you know the Andre Walker system, you know what I mean.  It is a beautiful hair type but very fragile.  She is 82 years years and last summer, had hardly any hair left in the front--not just the roots but the whole front of her head up to her ears had maybe 1/2  inch or less of hair remaining.  In the back, she had some hair, but it was ragged and all different lengths and felt rough.  She thought she was going to have to wear a TWA forever, like many of her friends her age who have basically jsut given up on ever having hair and shaved it off.  But she did not want to do this.  Though she is an older lady, she is very feminine and does not like her looks with this 'boy' type hairstyle.Anyway, to make a long story short, I sent her a bottle of this Jamaican black castor oil and she started massaging her hair and scalp with it.  I also made sure that she started sleeping on a satin pillowcase and wearing a satin cap, washing with her remaining hair in braids and using Shea moisture shampoo only on her scalp.  I told her to be very low manipulation and she wore a wig to cover up her damaged hair and give it a rest.  I taught her to finger comb only and also to use a little protein on her ends about once a month, after she washed. (Joico K-pak).  Lo and behold!  She lives in Florida and when I returned to visit her, barely 7 months later, her hair had grown so much!  the very short patches had grown a lot, the bald patches had filled in and the back had grown BELOW HER SHOULDERS.  My mother has never had hair below her shoulders in her life (this is difficult for many type 4b people as this hair type cannot take any abuse at all.  It was an unbelievable change.  My mother is so happy.  She continues to use this product as her scalp massage and moisturizer and her hair is not only growing like a weed but feels very fluffly, soft and not greasy at all.  Her goal is to grow her hair enough so that she can wear her natural hair in a bun and not have to wear a wig anymore and it looks like she will make this goal very soon.  We are both very happy.P.S I have type 3c hair which is a lot stronger than my mom's (my dad was mixed-race and I got his hair type).  I have never had balding or breakage problems the way she does,  but I find that this product works well for me, too.  I massage a little on my scalp mixed with some peppermint  essential oil (few drops) and burdock root oil (which I also bought on Amazon.com) every night and I don't have the itching problems I used to have sometimes before.  I think it makes my hair feel a bit softer (I have low porosity hair that tend to be dry) and I like it for me, too.

  AFTER: I usually buy OPI and sometimes Trugel nail polishes. IBD is inferior by all means. I purchased the color hot springs which is beautiful but took 3 coats and is still streaky. The brush is stiff which is a big reason why application does not go on smoothly. I use this with my led lamp.

  AFTER: I really haven't yet used this product as frequently/regularly as I eventually plan to. But so far, when I use this I encounter no problems whatsoever. My face feels fresh and looks better when I get up in the morning 9I use this product as a night cream to apply when I go to bed). I feel fine about this product I just need to buckle down and use it more often.

  AFTER: I have oily, thin, curly hair that I'm trying to grow out long and healthy. I blow-dry and flat iron my hair often and its damaging. I used this as a scalp massager. I would rub into my scalp and through my ends and let it stay on over night.....it def makes your hair oily (better for dry scalps). I decided to use this in the shower along with my shampoo....i would add shampoo and a quarter size of this castor oil in my hands, mix it up and work it through my hair.... then i will add it with my conditioner but only concentrate on my ends. I'm not sure if my hair is growing with this product, but it makes it very very shiny! (esp for someone who has damaged hair) i get tons of compliments asking if i went to a salon to put a gloss on it.... its very nice. I also dont think the smell is terrible...it has a light nutty scent but mixed with the shampoo , its perfect. Try it out!

  AFTER: Aveeno is another great product that I use often and have had very few bad experiences with.  This daily lotion is seriously awesome - goes on light and smooth, doesn't feel oily, and lasts all day.  It doesn't have a scent.

  AFTER: Pros:-It was a relief for itching from Psoriasis.  Now that my psoriasis is gone, I still carry a small compact bottle with this lotion just for occasional itch or mosquito bites.  For me, it works better than anti-itch or anti-puritic lotions just for a rash or itch.  As for as I can tell, perhaps my skin likes the oatmeal so I can't guarantee this for everyone.  I've also had a liking to Sauve oatmeal lotion, it smells a bit better and is very subtle like that of a baby smell/shampoo.-Oatmeal;-Odorless (could be a good/bad thing for those who prefer either way);Cons:  May be a little heavy bc the lotion is fairly thick.Neutral Comment: Shelf life is pretty good, but I wish it was a little longer.

  AFTER: I love this moisturizer, it hydrates well, it's not too thick and it never breaks me out. The only negative is the ingredients ( I wish stuff that worked wasn't loaded with chemicals) and the scent. It's very strong.Now, about the age defying properties, I don't think it actually does anything for the skin except moisturize and keep the complexion looking nice. I have few wrinkles but the lines on my forehead seem to remain despite using this product for a year consecutively. So, great moisturizer- that's it.

UID: 23561
  BEFORE: <none>
  AFTER: Initially put off by price but wish I'd tried sooner - would have saved money from trying products that don't work.  With this, skin showed almost immediate improvement - even more with time.  Pleasantly scented and initially soothing, this cream can also be put on over other (at least partially absorbed) skin products.  Great results - Highly recommended.

UID: 23562
  BEFORE: <none>
  AFTER: It seems to me that Amazon is a really great place to buy daily skin products like Aveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Lotion because these products are in many cases much cheaper than the average chain pharmacy (like Duane Reade or CVS in NYC). In addition, there are often deals like a package of 3 that can be cheaper still. So that's my plug for Amazon. As for this product, I have used it for years. I apply it to my body after every shower and I love the way my skin feels after application. If I do not apply it, my skin feels and looks taut, dry and sometimes scaly after Aveeno my skin feels smooth, soft and supple. In the summer I like to use self-tanner moisturizers so I get the opportunity to compare several other brands that purport to be moisturizing and there is no comparison with Aveeno. There are probably other good body moisturizers out there but I am not looking because I am very satisfied with the results I get with Aveeno.

  AFTER: I will never buy this brand again.  I recommend Perfect Match by Lechat Nails.  This was my first time to do gel polish at home.  I did the Lechat on my mom and it was beautiful!!! Perfect, in fact.  Was so excited to do mine with the Viking Winter by Just Gel Polish.  It was terrible.  It shrinks when you put in under the UV.  I did it over and over again and it kept shrinking!  Left bubbles and dents all over.  Lets just say it took bruising my nails to get it off and I hadn't even put the top coat on, yet.  Don't waste your time or money.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!

  AFTER: Sometimes I skip foundation, sometimes I skip eye shadow... I NEVER skip the mascara. It's the one item of make up I truly care about wearing. (Well, that and lip gloss. Anyway...)This mascara is amazing. Though I haven't tested it in the rain- I CAN say that it is long lasting. I worked a 14 hour day and was too exhausted to take off my make up before hitting the sack, when I woke up in the morning my mascara still looked great. I haven't tested it in the rain yet, buttt it comes off very easily with some generic make up remover I have. (The easier it comes off, the better, for me.)This mascara does not clump. I love it. My eyelashes look long and silky- they don't look like gross spider legs with this stuff. No flakes, no smudges. Highly recommend this one!

UID: 23565
  BEFORE: <none>
  AFTER: This mascara is in an easy to see, green container. The product does not clump as stated from my several days of wearing this. It goes on really well, not too thick or thin. The brush does a good job of getting my lashes evenly coated. The one flaw is that after a few hours of wear, if I accidentally touch my lashes, the black mascara starts to flake off my lashes. I'm not talking about rubbing my eyes or anything fierce, but just touching my lashes -- black flakes. It's not horrendous, mind you, but still annoying as I expect my mascara to stay on even if I touch my eyes a little bit.  But still, I do like that it doesn't clump, looks greats on my eyes, and is in a cute little green container (as opposed to a black one which is hard to find in my makeup bag).

  AFTER: I received a low value free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review. I was not required or compelled to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with FTC 16 CFR, Part 255.I like that this Soap contains Dead Sea Salt and Minerals from the Dead Sea located in Israel. Both ingredients known to provide healing benefits to the human body.This soap come in a small box that well represents Adovia's design and standards. The Soap it self is a good size and it should last for some time.It has a nice scent, but it is very strong, and it made my allergies go a bit crazy. So I was not really able to use it on my face, but I have been using it for my body and do like how fresh and soft it leaves my skin.As much as I like Adovia Products, and while I did like the end results of the Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap, I think it's a bit on the high price, and I'm not sure that I would buy it because of my allergies. If on the other hand you enjoy or don't mind strong scents and are looking for a high quality soap that offers many benefits this may just be the soap for you.A fact that many may find appealing is that this soap can be freely used on the body and on a delicate face as well. Leaving the skin clean, refreshing and soft feeling.I wrote a more detailed review at our site, you are welcome to check it out at craftyspices {dot} com

  AFTER: Thus far I like the product and the results. Would repurchase and recommend.  Next time I will probaby order one that has a scent like coconut or lavender.  The product is thick as other reviews have indicated but I like that b/c it does help &#34;lay them edges&#34; or sealing ends when rocking a twist and/or braid out.  I have also mixed with other oils like coconut and/or jojoba when using as co-wash, deep conditioning, or with leave-in conditioners.

  AFTER: OK I have always been a product junkie, spending too much on creams and lotions of all sorts. Never thought to use something as simple as an oil. I feel like I have just come across a gold mine! I initially purchased the product for my man once I read about its benefits in reversing baldness. As I researched a little more, I found many more advantages such as longer and thicker lashes and brows, tightening and softening skin, eliminating wrinkles and stretch marks, removing callouses and warts and other fungal infections, treating acne, shinier healthier hair....etc. So far I have only used it for a couple of days, and I am already blown away. The softening effect on my skin is nothing like I have ever experienced. Never again will I spend money on expensive face creams. Granted, the oil is a little on the thick side, so a little goes a long way. But if you put a couple of dabs around the eyes and massage them on your wrinkles before bed and very little before you go out, you will see the effects almost immediately! I also bought almond oil (since now I am believer in the miraculous powers of oil) just to mix it with since it has a much lighter consistency, and also high benefits to the skin.Another amazing effect is on my callouses on the soles of my feet, as I run a lot. Absolutely better than any foot cream I've ever used. I massage it in nightly and wear socks right before bed. Instant gratification! Been using it on my stretch marks too around my butt, and I already see changes!All I can say is stop spending money on name brands and go for the source. You will not be disappointed!

  AFTER: I've tried hoards of mascaras. This wears very well for morning to late afternoon. It will get you through a work day. And it doesn't run or bleed, so that's a great perk. But by evening, it flakes a little bit. Comes off easily with remover; doesn't require a waterproof remover or anything. It's very black, which I like. But the appicator is a little skimpy. I like fullness, so it's not my favorite. If you like separated lashes, this will be a good wand for you. It's also nice and long, which I like. Overall, a pretty good product.

  AFTER: This body wash makes a mild lather, and I can even use it for shaving. I like to use it on a nylon scrub puff and I find I don't have to use a moisturizing lotion after I shower or bathe, but it doesn't feel oily or greasy. The gel is rather thick, so it sits on the puff very well. It is a bit better in the shower than the tub, seems to leave a bit of a residue if you bathe. The scent is mild, like oatmeal or oatmeal cookies.I have allergies to a lot of things, sensitivity to most fragrances, especially strong perfumey ones, and bar soap leaves a residue (we have hard water.) This is a nice, mild body wash and leaves my skin very soft.One of the ingredients, in fact, the major ingredient, is sodium laureth sulfate, which is a detergent, somewhat less strong than sodium lauryl sulfate, and there is some feeling that shampoos and gels should be sulfate-free, but it is a good lathering detergent and seems to be mild enough.

  AFTER: Fast, gentle, light, hair dryer.  No frizz, quick drying results.  The diffuser attachment is rather large and hard to pack into a small travel bag but gives good gentle air. The dryer is very light to hold and has a cold setting to finish the job.  The motor can be rattling and rather loud but over all performance is excellent for daily use.  Don't waste your money on the expensive ones.

  AFTER: I like this product combine with an anti wrinkle cream it works well or with the anti wrinkle patch. Ok, this product you must be careful with to much pressure on the eye area will hurt.  So roll lightly.  It is like a little meat tenderizer that allows the cream, lotions, serum etc., to penetrate theskin so you will get faster results.  I liked it but stopped using it after a week, so I only gave it three stars.  But now that i am writing this review i will start using it again tonight.  Happy rolling!

  AFTER: I heard many great things about this brand so I decided to order one after trying the ZGTS brand. First off, this roller is waaaaaaaay less painful than the ZGTS. Even though I am using 1.0 from this brand and used 1.5 for the ZGTS, the length of the needles have nothing to do with the pain level at all. The ZGTS needles are really tough and painful due to them being made out of titanium steel which is supposely suppose to help the needles last longer which is complete bull! The needles are also placed different so you have some cross action rows going on. I will give it another month or two to see if it works for me and will definitely lower my rating if I dont see any improvements to my skin.

  AFTER: I used to love and swear by Aveeno but this winter the Aveeno lotion contributed to some sort of odd rash anywhere and everywhere I used the Aveeno. Each time I used the Aveeno the rash became worse and spread.. not good!While looking around for other lotions (this winter has been terribly dry!) I discovered the massage lotion that I prefer to use is actually less expensive per ounce than the Aveeno!  Once I realized my preferred massage lotion was actually less expensive and since I use these dispensers (Better Living Products Clear Choice Dispenser Three Chamber Shower Dispenser, White) for lotion anyway I realized I was better off purchasing the choice of professionals -Biotone Advanced Therapy Massage Lotion Gallon #ATL1G.  I now buy the massage lotion by the gallon to refill our lotion dispensers. The Biotone may SEEM more expensive but at the current prices it is in reality saving more than 40% per ounce AND is better on the environment since we are not discarding as many bottles over the lifetime of the product.

  AFTER: First of all I must say that this oil is about the best thing you can put on your skin. I had known about castor oil's reputation as a laxative and hair growth aid, but I'm very skeptic with "miracle" products, even when they're natural. But I have to say that this oil really impressed me. I have been using different natural oils like coconut and olive oil infused with rosemary leaves on my hair with very good results, but 2 days ago I applied this oil to my scalp and hair and went to bed with a shower cap on. I washed my hair the next morning and I was amazed at the luxurious softness of my hair, with a healthy shine and with volume, not a single sign of greasiness whatsoever. Just soft, beautiful hair. It actually feels like baby hair. Another thing is that I noticed much less hair breakage and shedding when I combed my hair in the shower. Just a few strands, because my hair was so smooth it did not tangle much. My hair is relaxed, colored, thin and dry and breaks easy, but I'm sure this oil is going to help me keep it moisturized and with less breakage.It also works very well on the skin, although I've never used it on my face, except my eyelids, eyelashes and eyebrows. I apply it all over my body every night after a shower and I wake up with baby soft skin that is not greasy. The oil is thick and kind of sticky for a minute, but your skin will absorb it completely after a while and it won't feel greasy. It makes my skin feel more elastic and young, and I only get that feeling with expensive firming creams I cannot afford to use all over. It is not completely odorless, but the smell is very faint and kind of goes away after a few minutes and it's easily covered up with lotion or cologne. It's great for dry lips and tired looking eyes. I apply a tiny drop on my eyelids and the area where dark circles form and massage. The next morning my eyes look fresh and eyelids and nice and plump. My son has chronic eczema and this oil keeps his skin nicely moisturized and doesn't irritate his skin like most creams do. I also put some on my hands before doing the dishes and protects my hands. This oil is a godsend and I see myself using it for years to come. I wish I could give it 10 stars.

  AFTER: I take a lot of pride in my appearance. I have used all sorts of creams for my face but the one I always go back to is Olay. I have been using it since my early 20's and am now in my late 50's. If you do the research like I have you will find Olay Regenerist in the top 10 of all other moisturizers along with the most expensive ones. No one believes I'm my age and even had people want to see my drivers license to prove it. You can't go wrong with Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream. I can't live without it. This is a 5 star plus rating for me. Try it and see the difference it makes.

  AFTER: I got this because everyone had nothing but great things to say in the reviews.  I was unfortunate to find that I don't agree.I have long thick eyelashes that look amazing with a little bit of mascara.  I like to wear it on both sides of my eyelashes so I need something that doesn't clot and clump when I apply both sides. I am a professional and I need to stay smudge proof all day long.This was hard to apply without getting clumpy.  I put my backside on first and then the front; by the time that I got to the front, it was clotting and it was a mess.  I would spend more time trying to clean it up.  This also smudges very easily.  I looked like a raccoon all day and it looked unkempt!I prefer L'oreal products and have returned after straying with this one purchase.  I would not recommend.

  AFTER: This is a 4.4 ounce white bar of soap and comes in a neatly designed blue and white box.  It smells great.  But, it's a little on the perfumey side.  This is not a product for the men folk, unless he's walking on heals from a recent pedicure and has his head wrapped up in a floral towel.There are over 26 Dead Sea minerals contained in the bar.  Also present are zinc, bromide, sodium, calcium, magnesium and palm oil.  The soap can be used on a daily basis without drying out your moisture-challenged skin.We love it.  It's just what we needed!

  AFTER: I don't do anything with a hairdryer except dry my hair (meaning I don't use it to "style" my hair).  This hairdryer does dry hair.  It's not as lightweight as you might think (which is why I bought it).  It's really kind of bulky.  Also, the buttons are too easy to push and located right where you hold the thing, so I'm constantly turning the dryer off when I'm using it..... annoying.  I guess I shouldn't complain too much about a product that didn't cost much.

  AFTER: I don't want to call this a miracle hair elixir, but this oil still has its uses. If anything, it works as both a remedy and a lotion. I also find that using this with the likes ofHeritage Store Castor Oil, 32 Ouncemakes for a terrific combination. So, I recommend getting this. Not because it performs miracles on your hair, but because it keeps your hair healthy.

  AFTER: All Adovia products are made in Israel. Whenever possible, I prefer to purchase products made in Israel. Dead Sea Minerals are long believed to hold beneficial and/or healing properties. Salt (and sugar) scrubs are a fabulous way to exfoliate your skin without using harsh chemicals. Adovia&#8217;s Dead Sea Salt soap is using salt as a gentle and natural way to slough off dead skin cells revitalizing your skin.I personally LOVE using sugar scrubs to exfoliate my lips prior to applying lipstick (especially matte lipsticks). I truly have enjoyed using this Dead Sea Salt Soap. I&#8217;m fairly picky when it comes to bars of soap that I&#8217;ll use on my body as I once had a doctor tell me that using Ivory was contributing to my itchy skin. He recommended that I ONLY use Dove which is milder and much more moisturizing. Amazingly this soap didn&#8217;t irritate my skin either.I like to exfoliate before shaving (my legs) as I&#8217;ve heard it helps to achieve a closer shave. I also like the how soft and supple frequent exfoliating leaves my skin. So if you are looking for a relatively inexpensive exfoliating bar of soap then I highly recommend that you check out Adovia&#8217;s Dead Sea Salt Soap.

  AFTER: While somewhat moisturizing, it did nothing to firm my skin. I used it nightly, after washing my face, toning, then using the serum in the same line. After a month, there was no difference. I switched to organic sweet almond oil, and saw more results from it in just three days. I have just ordered frankincense essential oil, as well as an immortelle blend that I plan to add to the SAO. I've heard of much better results going this route than to keep using these supposed miracle creams. I gave it three stars only because it did provide some moisture and didn't break me out as much as some products have. The shipping time was adequate.

  AFTER: I used to have really dry ends although I cut my hair about a 2 months from using this product. I researched the reason and the only reason I could find was that my hair was not very strong and I needed something like a hair reconstructor. I bought this product since I usually like going natural. I missed 1 teaspoon of honey with 1 teaspoon of coconut oil with 1 teaspoon of this castor oil, microwaved it until it all melted together and put that all over my hair. I left that it for about an hour and there is already a visible difference. The ends of my hair are no longer dry. I have used coconut oil with honey before but the affect of 2 together is nothing like the 3 together. Lots of the reviews were talking about it being too thick and unusable the solution to that is warming it up in the microwave for a few seconds.

  AFTER: I have been using the oil cleansing method for facial cleansing and moisturizer for over a year.  I have been happy with the results.  I decided to try adding this to my mix.  And I love it.This castor oil is thick.  I only add a little to the other oils.I also add it to the jojoba oil I put on my hands and elbows.  I have eczema and my skin doesn't react well to most lotions.  But this seems to work really well.I love the bottle.  I know that seems like an odd thing to say, but with oils I tend to find they use inappropriate caps and lids.  and the oils spill, leak, or pour out.  This lid is perfect for this oil.  you can squeeze out a bunch or just drip one tiny drop.

Our skin absorbs these toxins and don't we have enough in the air and our food and water. Cutting out toxins we have control over and Aveeno has the right idea.

  AFTER: So ive only used this twice in my life. It did hurt a little and left my face red on the first time but thats fine. Now after a month or so i tried it for a second time and thats when it scared me, besides the redning and pain on the sides a bit below my eyes it got swollen and felt a bit numb!I will try it again as it seems to be a wonderful product im just gonna have to order the smaller one for my more sensitive areas. I will be using this one on my butt to see if it finally gets rid of my tiger claw stretch marks lol*UPDATE 11/04/13Well this was def a piece of garbage on my facial skin. Ever since i rolled this crap on my face my skin has never been the same. My skin is still slowly recovering its scary! My face shows large pores and black dots which appears to be black heads throughout my face from my cheeks to my forehead to my chin :(It is really disappointing. Also it appears as if i have developed rosacea on my left cheek since there are two small spots looking pinkish purpleish and a bit swollen. This really makes me mad!! It has gotten better simply because i have been very persistent on my daily facial regimen care with natural products and scrubbing. This item will never again touch my face!! I havent even tried it on my butt for stretch marks like i said i would because im anxious it will get worst! If i ever develop the balls to try it there i will update whether for better or for worst, lets hope for the better if taken the chance!

  AFTER: I was nervous to use this because I don't use bar soap. I haven't used one since I can remember. Well I love Adovia products. When I received the product and open the package it was undamaged. I couldn't help but to smell it. The smell was amazing and not to over powering but does have a very clean smell to it. The soap is smooth and lathers perfectly. Its very moisturizing and natural with dead sea minerals. Left me feeling moisturized all day. It didn't even leave my face or body feeling dry. After the shower it has a lingering fragrance which is great. I love smelling good after a shower like you have just got out not like you only washed with water. Its not overpowering either but just very fresh. Loved it made my skin soft to the touch!!!!

I add this oil to shea butter for my hair creams and it whips to perfection.  I also used it alone after cowashing and my hair was sooooo soft.  It is VERY thick so be careful.  I noticed a big difference in the softness and strength of my hair when I used this product alone.

  AFTER: It seems to me that Amazon is a really great place to buy daily skin products like Aveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Lotion because these products are in many cases much cheaper than the average chain pharmacy (like Duane Reade or CVS in NYC). In addition, there are often deals like a package of 3 that can be cheaper still. So that's my plug for Amazon. As for this product, I have used it for years. I apply it to my body after every shower and I love the way my skin feels after application. If I do not apply it, my skin feels and looks taut, dry and sometimes scaly after Aveeno my skin feels smooth, soft and supple. In the summer I like to use self-tanner moisturizers so I get the opportunity to compare several other brands that purport to be moisturizing and there is no comparison with Aveeno. There are probably other good body moisturizers out there but I am not looking because I am very satisfied with the results I get with Aveeno.

  AFTER: I have thick, coarse, wavy hair to the middle of my back...that I like to wear straight. My old hair dryer would take a good 20-30 minutes to dry it, and that was with me brushing and pulling and exerting some effort. So imagine my wondrous surprise when this hair dryer did the same job in about 10 minutes--no lie! And it is SO light!!I do agree with some of the other reviewers that the buttons are not placed very well (although I only accidentally turned it off once), and I have to say that I wish the "cold shot" button was able to lock in the "on" position (like my last dryer did).I tested the sound against my old dryer (probably five years old, but the same wattage and also ionic), and they were about the same, but the Revlon is much lighter and dries the hair much faster. The air stream did seem a bit higher, but that was fine with me since I need that for my hair. And overall, my hair looked the same as it did with my old dryer.So, for a new mom with not much time for hairstyles, this hair dryer is a winner. It only gets knocked down to 4 stars because of the button placement and the cold-shot button.

Leaves our skin far more moisturized than other washes, and moisturizing bars, that we've used.

It was also more expensive than the regular oil for less product.

  AFTER: This soap fit easily into the palm of my hand and glides over my skin creating a light, clean, fragrant lather.  It rinses off easily and left my skin with a delightful, healthy glow.Usually after showering I must apply some type of body lotion to my skin to avoid the chalky, ashy look of dry skin.  I didn't apply any lotion after using this soap to test it's hydrating ability.  I was pleasantly surprised that my skin continued to look bright and healthy for over 8 hours.  For me this is Huge.  If there is a way to shave a few minutes off my morning routine, I'm all for it.  I will be purchasing this soap over and over again.

  AFTER: I am trying another Adovia product. I have enjoyed many of their products, and this dead sea salt soap is no exception. It is a pleasantly scented white soap that is very gentle on my skin. It contains over 26 Dead Sea minerals and trace elements derived from Dead Sea salt that cleanse and lightly exfoliate skin. I use this on my face and on my body and have not had any irritation or dryness. My face feels soft and clean.I love using this under my arms. It is very gentle and soothing and cleans me well. I am sulfate free and always looking for a nice alternative to chemical based soaps. After my shower,I apply organic coconut oil (small amount) under my dry under arms to prevent bacteria (bacteria is what causes odor (not sweat)). When the coconut oil dries, I put on my LaVanila lemon vanilla natural deodorant or I use my homemade mixture of tea tree oil, eucalyptus oil, lavender oil, coconut oil, coco butter, arrow root and baking soda (works amazing with no odor, lasts until the next day for me). This Adovia soap cleanses my skin well and makes a great preparation for my armpits before I apply my deodorant.I like how this has natural ingredients and there is not a long list of unfamiliar sounding chemical ingredients. I have used this soap EVERY DAY for the last month and it has lasted me well. I still have half a bar left. It does not leave a film or sticky residue and it does not have a strong fragrance. It smells clean and fresh. I think it would be excellent for those with acne or problematic skin.Key Ingredients:Dead Sea Minerals - Over 26 minerals essential for skin health including:Zinc: An antioxidant that facilitates skin cell renewal, helps repair damaged tissues,and heal wounds. Zinc is beneficial in stimulating Collagen and Elastin production.Bromide: Relaxing and soothing effect on the skin cells.Sodium: Improves the skin's ability to fight the free radicals that speed the aging process.Sodium in skin care can promote youthful and healthy skin with gentle skin softening and exfoliation.Calcium: An important ingredient in skin cell protection.Magnesium: Stimulates protein synthesis.Palm Oil - Natural oil forms the base of this soap. Allows for gentle cleansing and moisturizing without over drying.Full Ingredients: 80% Palm/ 20% Palm Kernel oil, Dead Sea Salts, Magnesium, Sodium, Potassium, Deionized WaterIf you found this review or any of my other reviews interesting or helpful, please rate is as &#34;helpful&#34; and or leave a comment.

  AFTER: I've been obsessed with my DIY gel nail kit that I got for my birthday and have already accumulated five colors (two Sephora by OPI, one Sally Hansen, and two IBD). To be honest, I prefer the formulation of IBD the best. I find that I have to do three coats (as opposed to two coats with the OPI and Sally Hansen). In terms of removal, I'd say they're all pretty much the same...As for the color itself (Sparkling Embers), I'd say it's a pale rosy gold - almost like champagne! Although there's definitely glitter, the color is subtle enough for me to wear to work (and I work in a pretty conservative commercial real estate office). The thin formulation allows you to pick exactly how much color you want on your nails (rather than just glombing it on all at once).When I first purchased this product, the shipping calculation said seven business days, but it was actually delivered exactly a week after I ordered it. As a long time Prime member, I'm used to the (almost) instant gratification of two-day shipping, but this was definitely worth the wait!

  AFTER: Pros:-It was a relief for itching from Psoriasis.  Now that my psoriasis is gone, I still carry a small compact bottle with this lotion just for occasional itch or mosquito bites.  For me, it works better than anti-itch or anti-puritic lotions just for a rash or itch.  As for as I can tell, perhaps my skin likes the oatmeal so I can't guarantee this for everyone.  I've also had a liking to Sauve oatmeal lotion, it smells a bit better and is very subtle like that of a baby smell/shampoo.-Oatmeal;-Odorless (could be a good/bad thing for those who prefer either way);Cons:  May be a little heavy bc the lotion is fairly thick.Neutral Comment: Shelf life is pretty good, but I wish it was a little longer.

  AFTER: OK I have always been a product junkie, spending too much on creams and lotions of all sorts. Never thought to use something as simple as an oil. I feel like I have just come across a gold mine! I initially purchased the product for my man once I read about its benefits in reversing baldness. As I researched a little more, I found many more advantages such as longer and thicker lashes and brows, tightening and softening skin, eliminating wrinkles and stretch marks, removing callouses and warts and other fungal infections, treating acne, shinier healthier hair....etc. So far I have only used it for a couple of days, and I am already blown away. The softening effect on my skin is nothing like I have ever experienced. Never again will I spend money on expensive face creams. Granted, the oil is a little on the thick side, so a little goes a long way. But if you put a couple of dabs around the eyes and massage them on your wrinkles before bed and very little before you go out, you will see the effects almost immediately! I also bought almond oil (since now I am believer in the miraculous powers of oil) just to mix it with since it has a much lighter consistency, and also high benefits to the skin.Another amazing effect is on my callouses on the soles of my feet, as I run a lot. Absolutely better than any foot cream I've ever used. I massage it in nightly and wear socks right before bed. Instant gratification! Been using it on my stretch marks too around my butt, and I already see changes!All I can say is stop spending money on name brands and go for the source. You will not be disappointed!

  AFTER: This is the best hairdryer I've owned!I have long, very thick hair, so I usually only dry my bangs and air-dry the rest; drying and styling my whole head can take more than 30 minutes. This dryer has shortened my drying and styling time to under 10 minutes, fresh out of the shower. It's also lightweight, so my arm doesn't get tired holding it. One thing I wasn't expecting was how great my hair would look and feel afterward; usually, after drying, my hair is coarse and wavy and I have to take a flat iron to it. After using the ionic dryer, my hair is smooth and shiny; no need for the straightener!

  AFTER: I am delighted with this body wash; it foams well, provides a clean feeling, has a subtle delicate scent and, best of all, really moisturizes! I have very dry skin and it's for the first time in a long, long while that I feel my skin softer and more hydrated. I use the body wash in conjunction with Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion and the results are very good. I have no idea what "colloidal oatmeal" is, but is seems to work, and that's good enough for me! Oh, and I only need to use a small quantity, so it's definitely worth the money.

  AFTER: Your skin will appreciate this lovely drink of moisture in the form of this astounding body wash. Leaves skin soft, smooth, silky, hydrated, and loved all while washing away dead skin and dirt!!I found this wash works best if I use it in my last few minutes of my shower. That way all the goodness doesn't come off completely. i really love that there's no smell to this wash. I find that works better for me because I love to wear perfume that I don't want to mix fragrances with. An excellent everyday wash.Pros:HydratingNO smell (so a great product if you get irritated by fragrances or you want to wear a perfume)Creamy lather, rinses away cleanlyGreat for itchy dry unloved skinCons:I need more.....

  AFTER: This is a go to moisturizer for people. Aveeno has a positive reputation where ever you go. It is a well known product.This is a  nourishing lotion which contains Colloidal Oatmeal blended with rich emollients to moisturize skin for a full 24 hours. I think it improves the health of my skin in 1 day with significant improvement in 2 weeks. It helps prevent and protect dry skin, it leaves skin feeling soft, smooth and naturally healthy-looking. It is gentle enough for everyday use, fragrance free, nongreasy, and noncomedogenic.I have been using the for several years and keep it in my bathroom.Recommended. prisrob 06-05-13

  AFTER: I was on a hunt for a peach gel polish. I was disappointed after purchasing the new Gelish Morning Dew color. Morning Dew was straight up Halloween orange. I don't know how they thought it was great for the new 2013 Spring launch. Anyway, this IBD color is great; pretty. I haven't found anything close to this color. Great color as an addition to my collection. IBD is one of my favorite gel brands that doesn't disappoint in consistency and in wear. I'll try to add a pic soon.

  AFTER: I love this soap and I love the scent.  One thing I look for in a soap is that it doesn't leave your skin feeling dry afterwards. This salt leaves my skin feeling moisturized, smelling great and the dead sea salt works as a good skin cleanser.  I would reccomend using this soap with the salts for an even better effect!

  AFTER: I was using Johnson & Johnson for my baby but the quality was not as good as Aveeno. She had Eczema problem and this helped.It moiturizes the skin in the summer without feeling sticky and contains enough moiture in cold winter days. Highly recommmended!

  AFTER: This is a good product. (Olay's new professional products line is really very good.) It lasted almost all winter (3 months) because it doesn't take much to cover the face. It did give a descent result - but not a dramatic result. If you are looking for a dramatic change in the surface of your skin it would be best to go with a prescription product. (They can only sell up to a certain strength without a prescription.) I don't like Retin A. I don't want too much skin to peel off, and I don't like they dry flaking it can cause. After selling many different skin care lines for many years and experimenting with others I've learned not to try to do too much of a dramatic change to the skin at once and peel a lot of layers off. Better slow than sorry. We only get one face. So, I don't want to peel my skin off eliminating too many layers at a time. It just seems dangerous to me, and I've seen some really frightening results. (I'm not a dermatologist, but when I've seen others try to peel many layers off at once it looks as if they will scar.) I also think micro-dermabrasion hurts, but that is just me. I've only done it one time.

  AFTER: I know that obviously it's a bunch of needles so it's not exactly the best feeling on your skin. I feel when I do use it, I feel my skin going into repair mode if that makes sense, helping your skin tighten. I use it alongside iodine for sebaceous hyperplasia, the needles along with the iodine help to go deep into the skin to eat up the oil that causes the big bumps.

Im SOOOO glad I did.My lashes curve down on one of my eyes, making anything too heavy clump easily and weigh them down, even with a heated lash curler. This mascara is light weight with a lot of body. Staying power to no end and a deep black color. LOVE IT!

  AFTER: This is a good product to use as a hair mask if you're trying to grow your hair out or eyelash enrichment product. I've also used it to help soften skin.

No more expensive Gelish, with there limited colors. Sorry Sally beauty supply.

  AFTER: I bought this because I had heard rave reviews about it on natural Black hair websites, and I'd also heard what it can do for your skin. It's good stuff, really thick, so I don't think it would make a good daily hair oil, but it's definitely good in a small amount in a mixture of oils, and in skin products. I mixed mine in both a shea butter concoction and hair oil concoction (both in a style similar to Youtube's Naptural85), and I'm very satisfied. The bottle looks small, but it does go a long way, and I still have more than half, although I do use it sparingly.

My face was so shiny at work the first day, I almost didn't recognize myself.  I don't have oily skin.  Might work for people that don't have sensitive skin.  Apparently that's not me.  Very happy to pay half the price with Amazon than the store!  I just can't use it.  Went back to Garnier Skin Care Renew with spf 28.  Cheaper product. Has spf.  Never breaks me out.

  AFTER: IBD Just Gel is a great gel polish for a great price.  The bottles are large and I have never had any issues curing them with my uv lamp.  I use them with Gelish Foundation and Top it Off.  My babe is a pale lilac/lavender color. Eden is a bold (almost) kelly green. Smokey Plum is between a grey and light purple color-the name says it all.  Cosmic Red is packed with red glitter in a red jelly base. Like ruby red slippers. I prefer it layered over a creamy red.  Bing Cherries is a true, fire engine red. This brand has always worn well for me. 2-3 weeks no chipping. (When applied and removed correctly, there will be no damage to the natural nail.)

  AFTER: It's not just for use as a nutritional supplement!Castor Oil has natural antioxidant properties, and absorbed into the skin it helps to naturally minimize and prevent wrinkles as well as stretch-marks, and it even conditions hair when added in small amounts to shampoo or deep conditioner treatment!Tip: A little added Castor Oil and natural vitamin E to a base of Coconut Oil or Jojoba Oil (ratios about: 1 part vitamin e oil, to 10 parts coconut oil and -part to 1 part castor oil) combine to make for a great all-natural body oil with full-on anti-aging properties!If skin is very oily, use it to spot treat areas (under eye area, stretchmarks, dry patches, hands feet) overnight and rinse in the morning. If skin is very dry, then daily use,full-on for the entire face and body will leave your skin noticeably supple and smooth and o-so--soft! Apply full strength overnight to dry hands and feet (cover with cotton socks and cotton gloves).Overall, it is an outstanding product, whether used to enrich smoothies or used topically. And a little goes a long way for healthier skin and hair.Our grade: B ; or 4-Stars!

The jury is still out on the hair growth, but the moisturizing claim is true....at least for my scalp and hair. I've used so many chemical on my hair, making my hair brittle, dry and my scalp flaky. I started using natural oils last month and the change has been nothing short of miraculous. I will continue with this brand of oil for years to come.

  AFTER: Overall, I felt this nail polish was good quality for the price. However, it was not exactly what I expected for a few reasons:(1) COLOR - From looking at the photo of the bottle, I thought this polish would be pink.  However, the color is actually silver with just a slight pink/purple tint.(2) TRANSPARENCY - The polish much more transparent than I thought it would be.  Therefore, I had to put on 3-4 layers to get a nice thick layer of glitter.  However, if you are looking for something that does not overload the sparkles, this polish may be for you.

  AFTER: While I occasionally splurge on Buxom Lash mascara, my tried and true mascaras seem to be the newer series of Cover Girl ones that have come out in the last few years orAlmay One Coat Get Up and Grow Mascara, Black, 0.21-Ounce.  While some folks hate the large brush and tube of these newer ones, I don't mind them, and I love the new bristle brushes that coat without leaving clumps.  I've already had good luck using the regular Lash Blast (the one in the orange tube), but I thought I'd try this new one to see how it works.  I really like it, and it really does leave zero clumps!The curved brush on this also does a nice job of adding a gentle curl to your lashes. The non-waterproof formula stays put, even when my allergies are acting up and my eyes are teary.I bought this in the Very Black color, and it's still natural-looking.Like all Cover Girl mascaras, this also comes off easily, with just some eye makeup remover or face wash and water.  You don't have to tug or pull at your eyes.It's a keeper!

  AFTER: I'm a fan of pastel shades, and yellow seems to be the most difficult to find that's worth anything.

  AFTER: I've made a few skin care changes recently, using this being one of them. I really think its making a difference! Basically I wash my face as usual, disinfect this with some rubbing alcohol, let it dry, and run it over my face and neck. I haven't wanted to press too hard, it does feel uncomfortable as you would expect, but it still pierces the skin. I follow it with the Cosmetic Skin Solutions 20% Vitamin C etc from here, stings for a second but quickly goes away. Next morning, my skin looks great. I've been doing it about twice a week, which seems to be a good frequency. I have noticed the occasional pimple after, not sure it's a causal relationship but probably my disinfecting routine could use some work. This thing is so cheap if you're thinking about it, I'd just try it. Just be sure to have a good disinfectant for before each use and serum for after.

  AFTER: I've had this dryer for about two years, and it held up pretty well during that time.  Recently, it started making a burning smell, and regular cleaning of the lint area hasn't helped, so I figured it was time to replace the unit.I originally bought this Revlon unit here on Amazon since it was rated as a Consumer Digest Best Buy, and it's a decent dryer for the price.  If you have shorter hair that is not too thick, this dryer should be fine.That being said, instead of buying a new one of these to replace my old one, I decided to upgrade to a Sedu brand dryer -- and the difference between the two is amazing.  With this Revlon dryer, it took me at least a good 15 minutes to fully dry my short, thick hair.  The Sedu dryer dries my hair in less than five minutes.If you want a good, mid-priced dryer, than this Revlon works well and will last a long time.  However, if you want a faster drying time, I wouldn't recommend this one.  I didn't know how slow this thing was until I splurged on a more expensive unit.Overall, I would give this Revlon unit 3 1/2 stars.

I'm not sure why, but several times when using this item, I've ended up poking myself in the eye with it too.  I think it's the shape of the wand.  It's not awful...just not great.

I switched to organic sweet almond oil, and saw more results from it in just three days. I have just ordered frankincense essential oil, as well as an immortelle blend that I plan to add to the SAO. I've heard of much better results going this route than to keep using these supposed miracle creams. I gave it three stars only because it did provide some moisture and didn't break me out as much as some products have. The shipping time was adequate.

After the first use, my itching was gone; within 3 uses the rashes had disappeared. For the first time in 40 years of pricey daily lotions and oils, my skin doesn't look dry at the end of the day.

I feel pretty good about putting this on my skin and my skin feels pretty good about it too.Compared to shower gel, it&#8217;s not as moisturizing, but for a bar soap, it&#8217;s not too drying.  It leaves me feeling very clean.  It also does a phenomenal job of getting rid of funk.  Seriously.  This is the soap to use after a workout or a long weekend camping.  I think it gets rid of stink better than most shower gels I&#8217;ve used.I am also in love with the fragrance of this soap.  It has a fresh, clean, laundry dried in the sun smell that I wish I could bottle and spray in my car.  Because it smells so good, I wish the smell lasted longer on my skin.  But I&#8217;ll take it making my bathroom smell nice and crisp after I shower.

  AFTER: Decided to try it out due to the rave reviews on Reddit's /MakeupAddiction. It does not deserve the hype. I didn't like it at all.It gave me very stiff, clumpy lashes. After a short period of wear it began to flake off and my lash-line became irritated and itchy. This is when I decided it had to go, and I took it off.I've never had an allergic reaction to a mascara so I'm guessing it was due to this product and not an overall sensitivity. I have full lashes, maybe it would be better for somebody with thin lashes, I kinda doubt it though.For a product named clump crusher, and then produced clumps, I mean come on. 1 star. I can't think of a mascara I've liked less.

  AFTER: I believe I'm seeing a difference in my hair. Because of the winter I'm really protecting my hair with a moisture treatment I do & this is great for it. I oil my scalp with this & other products together, and I can tell the difference in the thickness of my hair from this summer til now. If you have hair lose you should try. I also use on my edges. There coming in more now. Using on hair for a month now.

  AFTER: This hair dryer is the third in a series of attempts to find the right hair dryer for my wife, who has long thick hair.  The first one was a Vidal Sassoon that had ionic technology, but didn't get near hot enough.  She was drying her hair for > 20 minutes.The second attempt was the Revlon RV469 ceramic, which was much quieter and got hotter, but didn't have much air flow.  Also, it is quite heavy.  It was better than the first dryer, but not hair drying nirvana.This dryer (Revlon RV544) has easily cut my wife's drying time in half.  She has very thick & long hair, and the high heat setting makes quick work of it.  It gets hot enough that I actually tone it down to warm for myself (I have short, thick hair) whenever I have to use the dryer.  I think the air flow settings are perfect.  The dryer is also nice and light, and fits in a bathroom drawer easily, unlike some of the bulkier models out there.My wife thinks this is the best dryer she has ever had.  We highly recommend it.

  AFTER: Nowadays there are all sorts of skin care products and services that offer making one's skin feel better and look younger.  I came across this product by accident.  Unlike many high tech solutions (LED light, micrtocurrent, lasers) this is mechanical device with little needles that one can roll arond the face (my device's needles are 1 mm long).I was thrilled when I received this product.  It is small and very handy to use.  Needles are very small but very sharp.  Despite their sharpness, they will not hurt your skin, device will invirogate the top layer of the skin and one will feel tinkling on the parts that roller was used on.  I typically use this roller in the evening.  After I remove makeup, exfoliate skin, clean it with cleanser and tone, I use roller for a few minutes on my chin, cheeks and forehead.  I finish up by applying eye cream, face serum and night cream for face and neck.  It is still early for me to say if there are any significant results, but for now I just like the tingling effect that tool creates.  This tool comes in a handly little plastic container.  I wish there are better instructions on the box how to keep this tool desinfected after certain number of uses.  I guess, I will just emerse it in alchohol for a while and continue to use it in a manner I am using it now.

  AFTER: Been buying this body wash on and off for years. This is my go to and my wife's go to when we end up using a bad body wash and want to go back to something better. If you have sensitive skin this is the body was you need. The smell is nice and light, it provides a great lather and doesn't leave you feeling greasy or dry.

  AFTER: The soap smells amazing. Very fresh, very clean and not overpowering. It does not  get soggy in the shower after use. Something that I love because I really detest soaps that melt due to moisture and the mess it creates. This soap lathers a lot. Another thing I love. And it washes off easily and doesn't leave any residue so we know for sure impurities are being washed off. I have definitely seen an improvement with the acne on my skin. It has not fully disappeared but it has started clearing up. The redness is easing and those that did scare are lightening. The soap does not give me any extra moisture, so I still resort to my lotion application process of coconut oil and then my regular body lotion as normal.I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.

  AFTER: I'm using this in combination with coconut oil to put on my scalp to promote healthy hair growth and supposedly it helps with thickness so we'll see about that in a few months from now.

  AFTER: I received this product gratis, in exchange for a honest unbiased review.  I can say  with 5 stars, my skin loves this soap.  I love the texture, and how it fits perfectly in my hand. I barely drop the soap for it fits in my small hands just right, where regular bar soap feels awkward and super slippery.  This wonderful soap smells great and it is perfect for my dry skin.  I do not have to worry about showing off alligator legs when I use this soap.  I also love how the scent is fresh and clean, but not overpowering.

  AFTER: As I've reached the age of 50, my lashes have thinned out quite a bit.  NYX Doll Eye Mascara does add volume, but it can get a bit thick and waxy on the second pass of the brush.  If you can successully apply only one coat without drying, it looks great.  It doesn't smudge and wears well.  It is a bit difficult to remove, but I am only using warm soapy water when doing so.

  AFTER: OK I have always been a product junkie, spending too much on creams and lotions of all sorts. Never thought to use something as simple as an oil. I feel like I have just come across a gold mine! I initially purchased the product for my man once I read about its benefits in reversing baldness. As I researched a little more, I found many more advantages such as longer and thicker lashes and brows, tightening and softening skin, eliminating wrinkles and stretch marks, removing callouses and warts and other fungal infections, treating acne, shinier healthier hair....etc. So far I have only used it for a couple of days, and I am already blown away. The softening effect on my skin is nothing like I have ever experienced. Never again will I spend money on expensive face creams. Granted, the oil is a little on the thick side, so a little goes a long way. But if you put a couple of dabs around the eyes and massage them on your wrinkles before bed and very little before you go out, you will see the effects almost immediately! I also bought almond oil (since now I am believer in the miraculous powers of oil) just to mix it with since it has a much lighter consistency, and also high benefits to the skin.Another amazing effect is on my callouses on the soles of my feet, as I run a lot. Absolutely better than any foot cream I've ever used. I massage it in nightly and wear socks right before bed. Instant gratification! Been using it on my stretch marks too around my butt, and I already see changes!All I can say is stop spending money on name brands and go for the source. You will not be disappointed!

  AFTER: I love NYX, and I'm not surprised I love this mascara.  I normally use Clinique mascara, and when I say normally I mean everyday for the last 10 years.  I bought this because Clinique was out of my normal stuff.  I'm so glad I tried it because it's a great product.  It gives me length, and thickness.  It goes on smooth with no clumps, and the black is absolutely beautiful.  If you want a cheap mascara that wears like an expensive brand, I highly recommend this.  If you want something to just make your eyes POP and look amazing, then you definitely need to purchase this.

  AFTER: First off, let me say I am not in any way benefitting from this review.....I was amazed at the results.  A little about myself: I'm 40 and have recently (intentionally) lost over 30 pounds, have had a stressful last six months, and have an expressive face (I wrinkle my eyebrows a lot). So I started to notice creases above my eyebrows.  Stress, weight loss, and my continued eye wrinkling started to show. Ugh.  I can't afford medical intervention, but knew that I needed to do something. Just like everyone else ... I had seen the Olay commercials. I'm a natural born skeptic and hate to waste money.  $20-- ok, worth a try.I used the cream (light, non greasy, lovely) one night before bed. The forehead creases are noticeably diminished after only one day's use. I looked more rested and fresh faced.  I was completely surprised. I am anxious to see what a week's worth of use will do.

  AFTER: I was contacted to try and review this soap, and I jumped on the opportunity.  I've used Adovia products in the past, and was always so happy with the results.When I received this soap in  the mail, and opened it up, I found myself wanting to try it immediately.  The scent of this soap is just wonderful.  I love walking into my bathroom, and getting a whiff of the soap.  It's such a clean, spring-like scent.After using it for about 2 weeks, I noticed a big change with my skin.  So far, I've only used it on my face. It has left my face feeling super soft and help tremendously with my combination skin.  I struggle with dry skin around my nose and cheeks. This bar has really helped clear that issue up.Anyone who is looking to brighten up their complexion should give this soap a try.  I have noticed not only a brighter complexion, but a smoother complexion.  It's my new favorite facial cleanser.Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.

  AFTER: Now Foods does not specify if this castor oil is refined or unrefined, but it is certainly specified as Hexane free and expeller pressed, not cold pressed but in conventional form not organic or USDA organic form. Priced extremely reasonably, it is a good start but with new technologies, I found USDA organic with certification and unfiltered which makes it more expensive but certainly a better choice for me.CO is the most important oil out of handful of oils that I daily as beauty mix. I just put half the amount of shampoo, rub it in my palm to mix the shampoo and the CO, apply it as shampoo every single time. I place some CO directly on my head, scrub the scalp for removal of any residue on hair. Ricinoleic acid in castor oil helps to protect hair and stimulates circulation of nutrient rich blood to scalp. Dry scalp can lead to dandruff but CO's omega-9 fatty acids can help. I leave it for few hours and then wash it off. I place CO directly on my eye brows for hair growth. I mix with VCO since it keeps the mix not only liquid but runny. It is the best mix after shaving. I apply the mix to my whole body before mountain biking without any shirt or pumping iron at the gym. The mix keeps the bees and flies away.  I mix CO with AO to remove dark spots on my skin because of the scabs that I get from mountain biking. I blend CO with few more ingredients to make scrub, shaving cream and sunscreen.Any oil from any nut, seed or grain will go rancid, having no nutritional value shortly after production so I keep all my oils in dark containers, away from any light, air and moisture and use it quickly.

  AFTER: I tried this as well as the regular castor oil, I love them both but would probably prefer this one over the other one. This one cost a couple of dollars more but it works better in my opinion. I have natural hair and my edges were thinning from a hairstyle that I had that was too tight, this grew my edges back almost completely in 45 days, I could see some growth after 2 days. I also put this on my eyebrows for fullness and have friends that rub a little on their eyelashes. I had no problems with shedding like I have read in other reviews. This is my 3 bottle that I have ordered. The only slight problem I had was a small amount of leakage when shipped.

  AFTER: The color is a true Coral color.I have purchased several IBD Polishes on Amazon and really like the Brand.  The price is fantastic (Around $7 w/ shipping) and it last a good 10 days with no chips before it starts lifting.  This is pretty typical length for Gel polishes on me and I am very happy with that time frame.You need an LED or UV light and you cure for 30 seconds.  You also need a PH bond, Foundation/Base and a Topcoat to cure in the Light as well.

  AFTER: This was the first IBD color I purchased.  I'm a Gelish girl - but wanted to branch out to new colors and a different brand since Gelish hasn't really introduced any new colors I like.I used this color with Gelish Foundation Gel and Top It Off - and it worked perfectly.  It goes on similar to Gelish; I didn't really notice much difference.Gelish does have a color similar to this called &#34;Princess Tiara&#34;, BUT the IBD &#34;Smokey Plum&#34; is a little bit deeper and IMO a better fall color.

  AFTER: I got this because everyone had nothing but great things to say in the reviews.  I was unfortunate to find that I don't agree.I have long thick eyelashes that look amazing with a little bit of mascara.  I like to wear it on both sides of my eyelashes so I need something that doesn't clot and clump when I apply both sides. I am a professional and I need to stay smudge proof all day long.This was hard to apply without getting clumpy.  I put my backside on first and then the front; by the time that I got to the front, it was clotting and it was a mess.  I would spend more time trying to clean it up.  This also smudges very easily.  I looked like a raccoon all day and it looked unkempt!I prefer L'oreal products and have returned after straying with this one purchase.  I would not recommend.

  AFTER: I am 37 and starting to get those fine laugh lines and "crows feet".  I decided to give this a whirl.  While I like the unscented version better, the scented is still nice and not offensive; I have gotten creams in the past which are just too offensive and give me a headache.  My husband had commented on the earlier creams and for this one he hasn't said a word! (Not to mention the earlier ones did not work though I cannot remember, for the life of me, what they were; obviously I was not impressed.)The scented version has a light, non-offensive odor.  The unscented version has no odor (imagine that).  Regardless, they both do reduce fine lines!I was using it for about a week (8 days maybe?) before I saw a difference.  My fine lines were finer and less noticable.  (Probably no one but I noticed them before I started using this but it made me feel better and that is the point, isn't it?)And, when I got them, the exfoliating face-wash was being sold with it for half off.  And that is also a great product.I recommend this for anyone with light crease lines and who wants to keep their skin rejuvenated! I also highly recommend that you use the Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub Face Wash, as aforementioned.  I will also review that!

I use to have bad skin acne I saw on you  tube some reviews about BCO once I brought it I been hook ever since.  It does exactly what it says my eyebrows were very thin by me plucking them constantly.  Every night I used BCO to my brows and within weeks my brows were so thick and full that amaze me.  Also with my hair when I did my big chop I started using it every night on my scalp even used it as a hot oil treatment and my hair has grown so much it's a amazing product.  Everyone I know that has use this product has given it rave reviews and I see why great product!

  AFTER: I love this oil. I have very dry skin and hair and this along with a little glycerin in a bottle of filtered water creates the perfect moisturizing mist. I have naturally dry curly hair and this creates that seal unlike any other oil I ever use. Great for eyebrow and eyelash treatments also if they are thin or thinning! Only need a little as castor oil is very thick and sticky. But this bottle has lasted me forever and I highly recommend it.

I love that it is 100% all natural too..there are no weird ingredients.  I was noticing a little flaking and dry skin prior to starting with the soap but after I started using the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Soap it seemed to stop.

  AFTER: I used to have really dry ends although I cut my hair about a 2 months from using this product. I researched the reason and the only reason I could find was that my hair was not very strong and I needed something like a hair reconstructor. I bought this product since I usually like going natural. I missed 1 teaspoon of honey with 1 teaspoon of coconut oil with 1 teaspoon of this castor oil, microwaved it until it all melted together and put that all over my hair. I left that it for about an hour and there is already a visible difference. The ends of my hair are no longer dry. I have used coconut oil with honey before but the affect of 2 together is nothing like the 3 together. Lots of the reviews were talking about it being too thick and unusable the solution to that is warming it up in the microwave for a few seconds.

  AFTER: This is definitely one of the better mascaras I've tried in a long time. It goes on smooth, so clumps are pretty hard to get (unless maybe you put on more than two thick coats) and it adds volume to the lashes. Although it's not waterproof, I wore it out in the snow/rain much of the day and in the evening there wasn't a single smudge. That never happened with the other mascara I used. The mascara removed easily with a regular eye make up remover. I have sensitive eyes and many mascaras cause my eyes to become itchy or they dry out my lashes. I didn't have either of those problems with this mascara. So far, this one's a winner.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE 2/25/13: After using this mascara a few months now, I still like it, but I've changed my rating to 4 stars instead of 5 because although there aren't really any clumps, it tends to flake a little or smudge later in the day.

Im SOOOO glad I did.My lashes curve down on one of my eyes, making anything too heavy clump easily and weigh them down, even with a heated lash curler. This mascara is light weight with a lot of body. Staying power to no end and a deep black color. LOVE IT!

  AFTER: This light weight dryer dries my hair quickly without frying it due to the Warm setting on high.  I've been buying Tourmaline / Ionic dryers for years and would not consider buying any other.  It's quieter than my other dryers too.  I like the defuser for days when I want to go with my natural curly look without having to wait for it to air dry.  It's a steal on Amazon compared to my $100 dryers that do the same thing.  I was intending on leaving this one at my son's home when I visit him, but after using it I brought it back home with me and will leave another of my high priced dryers there the next time I visit.

  AFTER: This mascara didn't WOW me at all, it's just okay. It's slightly on the dry side, I prefer a thinner, glossier texture. This comes out thick on the wand, and clumps easily if you don't apply carefully. I will not repurchase.

  AFTER: All Adovia products are made in Israel. Whenever possible, I prefer to purchase products made in Israel. Dead Sea Minerals are long believed to hold beneficial and/or healing properties. Salt (and sugar) scrubs are a fabulous way to exfoliate your skin without using harsh chemicals. Adovia&#8217;s Dead Sea Salt soap is using salt as a gentle and natural way to slough off dead skin cells revitalizing your skin.I personally LOVE using sugar scrubs to exfoliate my lips prior to applying lipstick (especially matte lipsticks). I truly have enjoyed using this Dead Sea Salt Soap. I&#8217;m fairly picky when it comes to bars of soap that I&#8217;ll use on my body as I once had a doctor tell me that using Ivory was contributing to my itchy skin. He recommended that I ONLY use Dove which is milder and much more moisturizing. Amazingly this soap didn&#8217;t irritate my skin either.I like to exfoliate before shaving (my legs) as I&#8217;ve heard it helps to achieve a closer shave. I also like the how soft and supple frequent exfoliating leaves my skin. So if you are looking for a relatively inexpensive exfoliating bar of soap then I highly recommend that you check out Adovia&#8217;s Dead Sea Salt Soap.

  AFTER: Want long, voluminous, non-clumpy lashes? Look no further. This mascara is amazing! I have long lashes already. I wanted something that emphasizes that more and gives a lot of volume. This does exactly that. And the lashes are nicely separated and not clumped together making it look like I have 5 really thick eyelashes. The only thing I dislike is that it's quite difficult to get off, even with using an eyemakeup remover. It's quite a task at the end of the day to get it off completely because I put on many coats.

If only I had tried Aveeno when it was first recommended, I would have spared myself much misery, multiple doctor visits, and a bag of useless prescription creams. After the first use, my itching was gone; within 3 uses the rashes had disappeared. For the first time in 40 years of pricey daily lotions and oils, my skin doesn't look dry at the end of the day. This body wash is AWESOME!

  AFTER: I've tried hoards of mascaras. This wears very well for morning to late afternoon. It will get you through a work day. And it doesn't run or bleed, so that's a great perk. But by evening, it flakes a little bit. Comes off easily with remover; doesn't require a waterproof remover or anything. It's very black, which I like. But the appicator is a little skimpy. I like fullness, so it's not my favorite. If you like separated lashes, this will be a good wand for you. It's also nice and long, which I like. Overall, a pretty good product.

It does exactly what it says my eyebrows were very thin by me plucking them constantly.  Every night I used BCO to my brows and within weeks my brows were so thick and full that amaze me.  Also with my hair when I did my big chop I started using it every night on my scalp even used it as a hot oil treatment and my hair has grown so much it's a amazing product.

  AFTER: It doesn't feel oily and it dries in under a minute! It's practically unscented and makes my skin  smooth, soft, and protected. This is the best affordable lotion I have ever found. However it says call poison control if ingested. wtf. The skin is an absorbent organ! Humans can die if their skin comes in contact with poision and absorbs it! So this warning label made me very wary because even if some harmful substance is only present in small amounts in this lotion, there's a chance that there will be build up in my body as I have been using this for years. I'm presently looking for a new body lotion. Any suggestions, fellow reviewers? please leave a comment.

  AFTER: The most I had ever spent on a mascara was about $6 and never ended up being happy with my lashes. I've tried all sorts of brands that promise volume, curl, length ect, but I guess I was never to surprised with my outcome considering the price. Despite that, I could never see spending $20 or more on a tube of mascara that would only last me maybe 6 months, and worst yet, what If I spent the money and still ended up dissapointed. I bought the NYX Doll Eye Mascara on a whim, but it turned out to be the best mascara choice I've ever made.I always start out curling my lashes with a revlon metal lash curler. Usually my lashes don't hold a curl, once I apply mascara there back to their usual straight selves after drying. With the NYX Doll Eye, my lashes held a perfect curl all day. My lashes also looked ALOT longer and I have pretty long eyelashes to begin with so the result was very dramatic.The first time I used this, I only applied one coat and was very happy with the results, minimal clumping but the formula is thick enough to coat each lash nicely, perfect dark black color, shiny and noticable. Since I only wear eye makeup I want my eyes to stand out and mascara is my favorite for this.The second and third time I experimented with more layers. If your going to put on multiple coats I would recommend not waiting in between coats for it to dry. If you do this the result is clumps and messy looking lashes. After curling, I applied a few coats ( the brush holds alot of the mascara on it so unless you wipe of the brush before applying you may not need more on the brush for 3 or 4 coats ) angling the brush to fit in with my lashes which adds volume and oomph because of the way it is shaped. I used to prefer the spoon brush ( for extra curl ), but this style brush gets every lash just right and it is fatter at the ends where your lashes are the shortest and sparse and really plumps them up. The result of 4 coats were beautiful "baby doll" lashes which in my opinion looked even better than falsies ( which to me look funny and fake ).If your struggling to decide whether to try this or not, you really should. For the price of only $9 you will not be dissapointed.

  AFTER: This oil has a thickness and heaviness and a unique smell. I like to use it in conjunction with other oils to tone down the uniqueness of it's smell.  I like that consistancy that help other oils add moisture to the skin especially in winter weather and season.  Experiment with it and your favorite oils, you just might make a wonderful surprise.Just an update concerning this product; it works and penetrates areas where there is arthritis, you can feel the tingeling--not burning. The smell is easy to cover up so I want to give this additional info that can be so helpful to arthritis sufferers.

The dryer is quieter than her last one which was supposed to be quiet and certainly wasn't.  Quietness is very subjective while this is quieter I don't see how all you haired folks stand that noise for the length of time it takes to dry your hair.  This does a good job.

  AFTER: I just got this.  I've used it twice, so I can't really give a "review" of the product's performace or efficacy, but I can comment on the "smell" or odor that people complain about.THERE IS NO ODOR!  It's castor oil for pete's sake!  It's smells like castor oil.No big deal.  Once you put it on your scalp or hair, you can't even smell it.And the texture of this oil is not "heavy" either.This brand is "lighter" than the castor oils I've used in the past.  It dissolves quickly.I will add to this review at a later date if and when I get results, if any.Edit:01-14-12Observations:  WHY is this product called "black"?  This castor oil is CLEAR, like all other castor oils.

  AFTER: I use castor oil in conjunction with EVOO for the Oil Cleansing Method. Castor Oil is good for drawing out impurities in the skin, and when I felt a sebum plug in my hand, I was sold! I don't know if I plan to use it in my hair, but I definitely will continue to use it on my skin! It's a great oil, although it's very drying. This particular brand of Castor Oil is a great value, and 16 oz will last you a long time!

  AFTER: This thing is really the BEST mascara I've used.  The lashes look thicker and longer after use. The mascara adds a lot of volume and length to your lashes.The mascara doesn't smudge. If you get it on your upper eyelid, its very easy to remove;use a wet cotton swab and rub it off. It's also a very nice black. Although the little box doesn't look the same as the one shown in the picture. New design maybe? It doesn't make clumps and it's very smooth. I recommend this mascara. :)

I would use it more often but it hurts too bad and it makes me sneeze continually.  It also punctured the skin on my nose to the point that it was bleeding.  I am sure it makes the product you put afterwards absorb faster because your skin is punctured.

  AFTER: I was really excited about this mascara after reading all the good reviews, but it didn't turn out to be as good as I was hoping. The biggest problem is that IT WEIGHS DOWN my lashes, which is the most annoying thing for me. I don't have natural curvy eyelashes like some girls do, so I have to curl my lashes and hope that my mascara will hold the curve. That's the most important thing in a mascara I think, the ability to hold up lashes, not to weigh them down. NYX doll eye mascara does give my lashes volume and my lashes look fuller, but I just can't deal with the fact that my lashes are pointing down after applying this mascara. I'm very disappointed, but I do think if you have curvy eyelashes, this can be good for you. It's very black, and it does add volume.

  AFTER: I think this may be one of those items that is brought in from China as not an authentic item.  On it's first use, I went to use the cold shot button and it stuck to that.  I changed all the settings hoping it would get reset, but for the day, it did not.  I turned it on the next day and it was working again.  Pretty poor for a brand new hair dryer.  Also, it gets extremely hot to where it can easily burn your head, even on its lowest setting.  Total piece of garbage.

  AFTER: This is one of the nicest all natural soaps I&#8217;ve come across. Its first two ingredients are natural oils known for their moisturizing properties and does not contain any actual soap. No harsh chemicals to counteract the good and no extra fillers to cheapen the product.As I already mentioned, my skin tends to be very dry and itchy and it wasn&#8217;t until I began using Adovia Natural Dead Sea Mud Soap that I finally had an epiphany about the ingredients in soap. This soap, the moisturizing soap, doesn&#8217;t have loads of lather either because all of its ingredients are natural. No sodium lauryl sulfate! Sodium lauryl sulfate is the ingredient in soaps, shampoos and household cleansers (!) that cause them to lather up, and its dangers are well known.* I&#8217;m extraordinarily sensitive to sodium lauryl sulfate in oral care products. It makes my tongue and gums burn so badly that before I was clued in by a doctor I could only eat or drink items that were at room temperature. I was in misery. Why did it take so long for me to realize that it could be affecting my skin? I love Adovia&#8217;s mud soap for my body but this moisturizing formula is perfect for the more sensitive skin of my face.Adovia Moisturizing Dead Sea Salt Soap has a lovely light scent that doesn&#8217;t linger and that&#8217;s another huge bonus in my book. My skin feels clean, not tight, moisturized, not greasy, and soft not rough and uneven. I follow up with Adovia Dead Sea Salt Facial Serum and love the way my skin feels these days.

  AFTER: I'm a fan of Cover Girl products because they work well and aren't overly expensive.  This mascara doesn't disappoint - it goes on smoothly with the brush and doesn't clump on my lashes.  I like that it colors and defines my lashes without thickening them too much, since I'm a little too old to pull off a dramatic super-huge-eyelash look.This mascara stays on all day without flaking or ending up smeared under my eyes, and it washes off easily with soap and water or cold cream.My only complaint is the odd shape of the container.  It's small on one end and top heavy so it wants to fall over, and angled at the other end so it can't stand on that end either.  And it's too fat in diameter to fit in the openings of my makeup case.  I do like the bright green color, since that makes it easy to find in a purse.

  AFTER: I have tried many many many mascaras. I have been partial to Diorshow for a while (it is the least clumpy.) But it is kind of expensive, so I have been looking for a cheaper brand to wear everyday. Plus, I noticed as I have gotten older (sighhhh) that my lashes aren't as long and full as they were when I was younger. I figured waterproof mascara wasn't helping that, but still needed something that didn't give me raccoon eyes and stayed on all day.This got good reviews and for the price, I figured it was worth a shot!! WOW!!! I looove it!! I took a photo of before and after with no other make up. I tried to get close up so you could see my light-colored fine lashes and how this helped! This is 2 coats (which I don't always need) but wanted to see how this did. It did great! I still use makeup remover to get it off...I figure that oil is never bad for my eye area! ha ha!!I did have to separate a few stuck-together lashes with my pointy tweezers. That was probably due to the fact that I laid on 2 coats too quickly, because I didn't notice sticking this morning when I put it on for work. I doesn't last as long as waterproof mascaras, but my eyelashes don't feel as crunchy either. A VERY good mascara for everyday. And a good one for night time too (with an extra coat!)

  AFTER: This is a good product. (Olay's new professional products line is really very good.) It lasted almost all winter (3 months) because it doesn't take much to cover the face. It did give a descent result - but not a dramatic result. If you are looking for a dramatic change in the surface of your skin it would be best to go with a prescription product. (They can only sell up to a certain strength without a prescription.) I don't like Retin A. I don't want too much skin to peel off, and I don't like they dry flaking it can cause. After selling many different skin care lines for many years and experimenting with others I've learned not to try to do too much of a dramatic change to the skin at once and peel a lot of layers off. Better slow than sorry. We only get one face. So, I don't want to peel my skin off eliminating too many layers at a time. It just seems dangerous to me, and I've seen some really frightening results. (I'm not a dermatologist, but when I've seen others try to peel many layers off at once it looks as if they will scar.) I also think micro-dermabrasion hurts, but that is just me. I've only done it one time.

  AFTER: This is going to be one of those reviews where you wonder "does this person work for the company selling this product??" but I can assure you I don't have anything to do with them... I just love their moisturizer.  I have been using this for several months after purchasing it at a local big box store.  I have found other moisturizers to either be too greasy (leaving me with a shiny face) or too scented or too thin.  Some of them haven't "rubbed in" well and I find I have little white spots on my face later.This, to me, is the perfect moisturizer.  It has just a faint faint faint smell of something (Oatmeal?) very nice.  Just a little whiff that is one part Elmer's glue and 10 parts water and 10 parts oatmeal.  I know that doesn't sound that appealing but trust me, it's a nice scent.  It rubs in right away and leaves your face feeling really refreshed.  I fly a lot for work and often use this in the morning before a long flight.  I'm surprised well into a long (14 hour) flight how moist my face still feels.  So it lasts.You can read my other reviews and see I don't give out 5 stars very often...but I really like this product and highly recommend it.  I just ordered the same moisturizer with 15 SPF which sounds like an improvement on an already perfect moisturizer.

  AFTER: This is one of two products in the world that I really have a hard time living without (the other is q-tip brand cotton swabs). I have bottles by every sink and in my purse and gym bag.I'll admit I am highly picky about hand lotion. This is the only one I love. I put this on and my hands just feel good- they don't feel like lotion is on them or like they are greasy or slippery or heavy or dry (how do some lotions make hands feel dry?! I'll never figure that one out) they just feel like my hands, as perfect as they can be.The product has a very slight scent, but I don't really notice except when I am trying to smell it. I would definitely categorize it as "unscented"It really doesn't do much for heavily damaged areas, like the bottoms of my feet, but then, I wouldn't expect it to. That requires a targeted heavy cream that would feel gross on my hands and body. So that's really the only area I don't use this on. I actually even used this as a facial moisturizer for years (and still do in a pinch), but since I am now in need of wrinkle cream, I don't do that consistently anymore.When I studied abroad in college I did not take any Aveeno. Big mistake. I honestly thought about it every day. So when I was taking a 3-month trip out of the country last year, I prioritized my Aveeno, and even though it meant throwing out clothes at the airport to get my bag to meet weight restrictions, it was worth keeping enough Aveeno to get me through.

  AFTER: This product is a great deal for the price.  I believe it works as well as much more expensive department store products that make the same claims.  I have sensitive skin and rosacea, so was pleased when I found something that doesn't irritate my skin.

  AFTER: It is a good product. Great for lengthening lashes. So much so that I get mascara on my brow bone when I blink after application. It doesn't clump even when applying second coat, but doesn't thicken lashes any way. They just get longer.

  AFTER: I use this awesome moisturizer every day.  In winter my face (especially cheek area) is much drier so I need a heavier daytime moisturizer.  This makes my skin feel great, but isn't oily.

  AFTER: I'm super picky about my mascara and have used the same brand forever but after trying this it is now my new fave!  The brush is really good not your typical super bristly kind.

  AFTER: I have old stretch marks and loose skin from my pregnanacy and hoped to get rid of them with this and Palmer's oil with collagen, that I also bought on amazon.  I have noticed a little decrease in the appearance of the stretch marks, however the loose skin is still loose!  This is not too painful to use on my abs so I will continue to use it and hope to see results later.  I have been doing this for about a month 2-3 times per week.

  AFTER: I've been using it for 3 days and I already see a difference around my laugh line, basically it's gone. To be fair, I had the beginning stages of laugh lines and this combined with my normal skin care work wonderfully. It is important to note that I should have purchased the 0.5mm because the 1.0mm stings. I'm still getting used to the shock of the stinging sensation. Its stops immediately  after you're done passing the area in your face. Also, make sure that your skin care doesn't add on to the inflammation of your face. I used Apple Cider Vinegar as my skin toner and I make sure not to use it the same day as I use my micro needle roller. Please be aware that sunscreen is very important. I am a person of color and I use the sensitive Oil Of Olay sunscreen moisturizer. I have not broken out at all using it for the year and a half that I've used it.Again, this product is a great complimentary with your skin care line just make sure that you don't use products that is alcohol based or inflammatory skin care product the same day. You'll need a soothing product. If you use natural products I'd suggest a little grapeseed oil afterward on your skin.Oh most importantly, wash your face first and I forgot to mention DO NOT ADD PRESSURE as you roll the micro needle roller on your face. Just roll it on your face, for me I roll it twice around in one direction. You may try it differently but do not add pressure the needles are already doing their job.Hope this helps someone with sensitive skin.

  AFTER: I use castor oil on my hair for growth and repair, as well as my skin for drawing out inpurities. Though it does kinda smell expecially if you use a bit of it. Its heavy thick and a little sticky....I found it best to wet my face or hair before applying it so it spreads better and you use alot less. It doesnt make me itchy either like some have said. 16 oz is plenty, I've used enough and still have alot left!

  AFTER: Olay Regenerist Microsculpting Cream does what it is advertised to do.  This is the third or fourth jar that I have had, but this is the first time I've ordered it from Amazon, and Amazon's price is good.I've tried much more expensive facial creams and lotions and they either didn't work as well, or for the money they were no better.  The Microsculpting Cream is a rich cream that doesn't go on heavy, but has just enough moisturization for my combination skin without being too much or leaving my skin too dry.  The best feature of the cream, for me at least, is its sculpting ability, especially around the jawline.  After a couple of weeks of use, I can always see my jawline tighten up enough that it's noticeable.  At 66, that's definitely worth it!I chose to get the scented cream just because I enjoy a little scent to cosmetic products, but it is available in unscented.  It doesn't take a whole lot for one use, so this lasts a good while. Since I have a mild case of rosacea, I put a thin layer of Finacea lotion (from my dermatologist) on first, then the Regenerist Cream.  It's good for the neck, too.Highly recommended.

  AFTER: My review is on the whole experience of the product and SellerShippingShipping was fast, was delivered before the system could even catch up ..next day ! Great shipping. It arrived packaged perfectly.ProductThis product at first to me was a dud. I wanted to seal my polish ( Non UV Polish) which I do with my other UV coats. This product DOES NOT work with regular nail polish :(. Then I tried it on my overlay and it was tacky, much more tacky than other brands.It dries at a normal paceThe shine is a great luster shineSuggestions:Remember to use rubbing alcohol once you set the UV coat to remove the excess product build up and to remove the tackiness. Apply a really, really thin layer to get the best results.If you are looking a for a Top coat for your solar nails, natural nails and or overlays without polish this is a great product.If you are looking for a Top coat that will seal and secure ANY Polish..try Gelish or Seche brands.

  AFTER: Yet another superb product from Adovia!  I have now tried 2 products from Adovia containing the dead sea salt minerals and I have not been disappointed in either one.  I have been using this bar of soap for 4 days now and my skin is so soft and I feel so much more clean when I get out of the shower now.  I live in a very old house that has TERRIBLE water with rust and even the water softener does not help.  Since I started using the Adovia products I received my hair and skin has been so much better!  Using this soap has actually even helped reduce my acne.This soap smells so clean and fresh; comes in a regular size bar and is a very silky smooth white color.  The moment I opened the box from Amazon I could smell it and it was like heaven :)  I love body products that are not heavily perfumed but just smell wonderfully fresh.  You can most definitely smell the ocean in Adovia products, and of course with all of the minerals from the Dead Sea Salts it is always good for your skin.This specific product retails for $11 on Amazon and although it may seem expensive for a bar of soap, the benefits FAR outweigh the costs if you appreciate the healthiness that comes along with using the product :)  Just check out the gorgeous photos of the sea salts that make the products!  Imagine being able to swim in that water every day and the health benefits it would bring!  Then just think of this soap and if you try it you will be hooked!***I received a complimentary product in exchange for an honest and open review***

  AFTER: Bought this to toss in my bag for use at work and on the go. The product rubs in easily and is not greasy on the hands. I work constantly with paper at my job and also tend to wash my hands more often than most. Both of these activities tends to dry out hands and this lotion has been a real skin saver for me. I no longer have cracked skin with bloody knuckles from the drying paper and soap from washing. Small enough that I can keep one in my desk and one in my purse or backpack.

  AFTER: This truly does crush clumps. The wand is curved, with a thinner inner side, to lay down product, and a fatter outer edge that can comb and separate lashes, not that they needed it. I got the results that would normally require a lash comb.Unlike the other fat wand CG mascaras, I also didn't poke myself in the eye trying to reach the base of my lashes. No flaking all day and my lashes are as soft as if I were not wearing mascara. A great product, and I find other mascaras to be a compromise. Good stuff,!

  AFTER: Great mascara! I definitely like it better than any of the drugstore brands of mascara I have tried, and it's not that much more expensive. It's at a good price on Amazon (the same or cheaper than what I've seen it in the stores). It gives my eye lashes a nice full look, without the clumps. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants something more than the drugstore brands can offer but less that's less expensive than the department store mascaras.

  AFTER: I read some great reviews for the Aveeno body wash and body lotion so I decided to try both of them. I use the Aveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Body Wash with Natural Oatmeal when I take my shower. It is like a cleanser that leaves my skin soft without the feeling of a film or an oil. After the shower, I follow up with this lotion.This lotion makes me feel moisturized. It blends into the skin quickly and easily and you can tell when the product has blended into your skin--you don't have to go on rubbing for ages. It doesn't really have much of a smell although sometimes I will get a whiff and it has kind of an odd scent but by the time you rub it in there really isn't a smell that I am aware of. This is great because if you wear perfume you don't have to worry about fragrances clashing. If you are like me and avoid perfumes, this is great because perfumey lotions make my nose itch and then I start sneezing.This lotion is not like any other lotion I have tried. It does not make me feel greasy like some lotions. The consistency does not feel watery so that while I am putting it on it feels like slightly thickened water and when I am done putting it on I know have to put on two more layers of lotion to get a decent layer of moisture on my skin. Unlike other lotions, my skin does not dry out and look dried out a few hours after putting it on. Unlike other lotions, this one is not overbearingly thick, requiring extra muscles to spread the lotion and rub it in.Basically, when you are done it feels like your skin, like you aren't wearing anything, like the way your skin is meant to feel rather than feeling like your skin is covered with layers of a moisturizing product.

  AFTER: I started using this recently and really like how my skin feels clean but not tight or dry. I have been using it morning and again in the evening. I put on my usual moisturizers and makeup during the day and at night I use it to clean my face of all the makeup and then I use my moisturizers.  My skin looks and feels good.  I love that it is 100% all natural too..there are no weird ingredients.  I was noticing a little flaking and dry skin prior to starting with the soap but after I started using the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Soap it seemed to stop. My skin has been looking really nice and it feels comfortable, not tight or dry.

  AFTER: This is one of the nicest all natural soaps I&#8217;ve come across. Its first two ingredients are natural oils known for their moisturizing properties and does not contain any actual soap. No harsh chemicals to counteract the good and no extra fillers to cheapen the product.As I already mentioned, my skin tends to be very dry and itchy and it wasn&#8217;t until I began using Adovia Natural Dead Sea Mud Soap that I finally had an epiphany about the ingredients in soap. This soap, the moisturizing soap, doesn&#8217;t have loads of lather either because all of its ingredients are natural. No sodium lauryl sulfate! Sodium lauryl sulfate is the ingredient in soaps, shampoos and household cleansers (!) that cause them to lather up, and its dangers are well known.* I&#8217;m extraordinarily sensitive to sodium lauryl sulfate in oral care products. It makes my tongue and gums burn so badly that before I was clued in by a doctor I could only eat or drink items that were at room temperature. I was in misery. Why did it take so long for me to realize that it could be affecting my skin? I love Adovia&#8217;s mud soap for my body but this moisturizing formula is perfect for the more sensitive skin of my face.Adovia Moisturizing Dead Sea Salt Soap has a lovely light scent that doesn&#8217;t linger and that&#8217;s another huge bonus in my book. My skin feels clean, not tight, moisturized, not greasy, and soft not rough and uneven. I follow up with Adovia Dead Sea Salt Facial Serum and love the way my skin feels these days.

It dries my hair in five minutes, compared to twenty minutes with my old dragon dryer (you know the one, practically spits fire and weighs a ton!).  This does blow fast, even on low, but that is the great thing about it! The dryer is so LIGHT! 14.8 ounces to be exact! I just can't tell you enough about why I love it! The shipping was free, and the price was half what it is in the store.  If you have fragile hair, this is for you. If you have thick hair, this is for you. If you have frizzy hair, fine hair, any hair.. well you get the idea!

Not only does it leave my skin soft and smooth, it smells AMAZING.  I don&#8217;t like super strong smells, but this smells clean and nice without being overpowering like perfume.  Plus, I have super sensitive skin, so some products that I can use on my body, I can&#8217;t use on my face because it will break out.  This doesn&#8217;t  - my face is perfectly fine with this as an in-shower cleanser.  Love it!  I will definitely be purchasing this again!The price is outstanding and it lathers really, really well.  I will definitely be purchasing again in the future!

  AFTER: Cleansing every morning has become a spa like experience thanks to Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap. I work the Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap into a deep, rich lather and rub in small concentric circles around my face until it is completely covered in the Sea Salt Soap at which point I begin to rinse with cool to warm water until all traces of the soap have vanished.My skin has never felt so clean, and I am being completely honest with you when I tell you that washing my face has never been so pleasurable. I&#8217;ve used liquid face soap religiously for the past 10 years, at least, not a bar soap, but I am loving the results I&#8217;m getting from Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap. I used to only wash once per day, in the morning, because the liquid soap left my face feeling dry and tight, but with Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap, I wash morning and night.There is never a residue with Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap and my face feels refreshingly clean. Adovia&#8217;s bar soap lather is very light whereas the liquid soap I&#8217;d been using felt like there was always a layer left on my skin. I hadn&#8217;t noticed that leftover residue until I switched to Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap and I don&#8217;t think I will go back to a liquid cleanser again.The price point is right up my alley. At $11 a bar, I feel like I am getting this cleanser at a steal. Compared to other bar soaps I&#8217;ve used in the past as a cleanser, I don&#8217;t feel that they lathered as well or left me feeling as fresh and clean as Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap.Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap also has an amazingly clean fresh scent that you can smell before you even take it out of the box. I love awakening my senses to the smell of Adovia&#8217;s Dead Sea Salt Soap in the morning. It makes me feel like I am doing something good for my skin and feeling good in my skin couldn&#8217;t come at a better price.

  AFTER: I've been using it since 2009 and nothing could replace it. I still like it over some other brands I tried lately, but I started looking again because this cream seem to have a lot more silicon in it now. I usually use BB cream or foundation over it, now I could hardly get the cream absorbed enough even after 10 minutes. I really hope Olay would stick to the original formula! I'd give it a 5 star if there is not that much silicon.

  AFTER: i haven't used any needle roller before and I did try it once, I don't think I even punctured my skin, I was barely touching it on my face and it was a little too much for me, but I am a sissy with pain. So I ordered the 0.5mm size and that one I can tolerate and do properly. Just remember to clean face and hands good, always use clean/disinfected roller. I just used the bleach and water solution and soak it for 10 mins, but just bought some alcohol and will be using the alcohol to disinfect it a little.When rolling, roll in one direction, someone recommended to just roll once direction, then lift and roll again. I did try that roll once, but now I get the hang of it, I can roll on the same area without moving the roller to much, repeat 8-10 tiems. When you move the roller while rolling it can potentially cut your face so please be careful. You will notice your face turning red and some areas where its not too red, then I just go over that area with a roller again. I had been doing this for 2 weeks now so haven't really noticed a significant change. But I can tell that when I applied the Hyaluronic with C & E, it really gets soaked up right away and my skin is softer. Also I was doing the peel and had noticed some chages on my pores, getting smaller, yeeey! So I really dont know whats working, but Im sure its the combination of Peel, Roller and Hyaluronic acid.

  AFTER: I got a Shellac manicure when the gel craze started out and it didn't work well for me at all after having 3 different techs apply it. It only lasted a few days. Gelish fared a lot better but after researching I learned that techs weren't doing everything they could to maximize wear such as applying it to the free edge and making sure the nail plate is 100% free of debris.So I purchased a Gelish Foundation and Top It Off and a Nail Spa two hand UV lamp from Amazon. Sure enough it worked perfectly with extra attention to getting the nail plate clean and using a non acid primer from Sally's (not necessary but it's hard to keep a manicure on my nails). But Gelish was far too expensive. I have tried every gel out there and the best by far is Nail Labo Presto Gel (black is totally opaque in one coat so is white) but it's also pricey. I turned to Amazon and found IBD. I googled IBD swatches and found the amazing color payoff and good reviews. Sure enough it is awesome but you do have to commit to three coats for some colors. I adore how cheap it is and the color range, not to mention how big the bottles are.

  AFTER: This mascara is okay. As it claims, it adds volume and a little length without clumping. The biggest drawback, however, is that it starts flaking after a couple of hours, leaving a residue under my lower lashes. I usually use Covergirl's "professional" mascara, and although I don't think it provides quite as much volume as this one does, it doesn't flake or smear, no matter how long I wear it. Every other mascara I've tried does one or the other. This one didn't smear, but flaking was an issue.

  AFTER: best everyday lotion.really does work if you use consistently. i like how it' is pretty much unscented so it won't clash with perfume if i choose to use it

  AFTER: I use this on my face for acne (which has really worked) as well as replacing my moisturizer and on my hair for softness (which has also worked.) I've been using on my face everyday for two weeks and my hair 1-2 times per week during that span. It looks like hardly any is missing from the bottle--so a little bit goes a LONG way! For the price offered here, you really can't go wrong. I imagine this will last at least 3-4 months.

  AFTER: I was a devoted fan of Covergirl's Lashblast Volume (in the orange tube) as it gave my lashes the fullest look for the best price, but I always had issues with a coating of flakes beneath my eyes before the day was even up! I decided to give this a go based on the other positive reviews (it's the highest reviewed drugstore mascara I've seen on Amazon) and it was worth every penny!! It gives my eyelashes lots of length and volume and to my complete amazement... NO FLAKES! HALLELUJAH! After years of searching, I've found my mascara soulmate!

  AFTER: I really like this mascara! I HATE clumps and I have long lashes but I like them thicker. This lets me use a few coats to get the thickness I want without the creepy clumpy spider leg lash look.

  AFTER: I have to mix it with glycerine to give it 'slip'.  When I mix it, I use it on my body---feels too thick and heavy to put on my hair.  I know some 'naturals' love this stuff but, perhaps I have a psychological resistance to just the words 'castor oil'.  And that old smell is still there.  Remember when your grandmother used to make you take it cuz you were plugged up?  Eeeew!Fortunately, no one can make me eat this stuff!  Perhaps if someone would share with me some incredible natural hair or skin recipe I'd incorporate it more into my routine.  But as it currently stands, I'll stick to my glycerine and coconut oil.

  AFTER: It seems to me that Amazon is a really great place to buy daily skin products like Aveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Lotion because these products are in many cases much cheaper than the average chain pharmacy (like Duane Reade or CVS in NYC). In addition, there are often deals like a package of 3 that can be cheaper still. So that's my plug for Amazon. As for this product, I have used it for years. I apply it to my body after every shower and I love the way my skin feels after application. If I do not apply it, my skin feels and looks taut, dry and sometimes scaly after Aveeno my skin feels smooth, soft and supple. In the summer I like to use self-tanner moisturizers so I get the opportunity to compare several other brands that purport to be moisturizing and there is no comparison with Aveeno. There are probably other good body moisturizers out there but I am not looking because I am very satisfied with the results I get with Aveeno.

  AFTER: This is going to be one of those reviews where you wonder "does this person work for the company selling this product??" but I can assure you I don't have anything to do with them... I just love their moisturizer.  I have been using this for several months after purchasing it at a local big box store.  I have found other moisturizers to either be too greasy (leaving me with a shiny face) or too scented or too thin.  Some of them haven't "rubbed in" well and I find I have little white spots on my face later.This, to me, is the perfect moisturizer.  It has just a faint faint faint smell of something (Oatmeal?) very nice.  Just a little whiff that is one part Elmer's glue and 10 parts water and 10 parts oatmeal.  I know that doesn't sound that appealing but trust me, it's a nice scent.  It rubs in right away and leaves your face feeling really refreshed.  I fly a lot for work and often use this in the morning before a long flight.  I'm surprised well into a long (14 hour) flight how moist my face still feels.  So it lasts.You can read my other reviews and see I don't give out 5 stars very often...but I really like this product and highly recommend it.  I just ordered the same moisturizer with 15 SPF which sounds like an improvement on an already perfect moisturizer.

  AFTER: Something was just off about my appearance when I was using Very Black (or whatever the darkest black shade is). I'm Asian and my hair is a very dark brown with a reddish warm hue, so even though subtle, the blackest black shades just looked a bit artificial. This Black Brown shade is amazing. I love that my makeup looks softer, more natural, and without any clumps in sight - are they natural? Is she wearing mascara? I love it. The brush is just perfect, too - very rarely make mistakes and I manage to get every hair I want to. Sometimes reaching the hairs near the corners can be frustrating with other types of brushes, but this gets every one, and I don't end up with clumps in the process!

  AFTER: It was time to try a new mascara, because the "lengthening formula"  I'd been using ( L'Oreal Telescopic Lengthening Mascara)  clumped terribly, almost gluing my lashes together. (Uni-lash is not a good look!)I'm so glad I tried Covergirl Clump Crusher Mascara. I LOVE it, because it adds a ton of lush, natural looking volume, has an intense black color, and it DOES NOT CLUMP.It also stays on all day without smudging, and is very easy to remove  ( I use a basic foaming face-wash product which is safe for use around the eyes).I'll purchase this product again, because it is the only mascara I've tried that is truly clump-free.

  AFTER: I give this 5 stars due to the things I consider extremely important in a gel polish.#1 is opacity. This polish took 2 coats to be opaque. That's wonderful!#2 is application. This polish applied wonderfully. Not streaky or too runny. Didn't pool in the cuticle area.#3 is shrink back. This polish has ZERO shrink back. As long as you cap the free edge as usual, there's no shrinking issues.#4 is price. You can't beat the price of IBD Just Gel polishes. They are all very reasonably priced.#5 is lasting power. This polish lasted 2 weeks and 4 days, zero chipping, cracking or peeling. Its looked flawless for the entire manicure.Black lava will now be my go to black gel Polish. Its simply black, no shimmer or frost. Its better than some of the expensive black gels I've tried and lasts way longer and applies better. Also the brush is in my opinion one of the best. Not too big, not too small. Doesn't make a mess of my cuticles :)

  AFTER: I am delighted with this body wash; it foams well, provides a clean feeling, has a subtle delicate scent and, best of all, really moisturizes! I have very dry skin and it's for the first time in a long, long while that I feel my skin softer and more hydrated. I use the body wash in conjunction with Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion and the results are very good. I have no idea what "colloidal oatmeal" is, but is seems to work, and that's good enough for me! Oh, and I only need to use a small quantity, so it's definitely worth the money.

  AFTER: I have a difficult time with mascara clumping and find the look so awful that I often go without.  So far this is not clumping and also seems to stay on very well.  No specs in the eye or ugly smear underneath.  This will make me use mascara more frequently and look for this product in the store next time I shop.

  AFTER: I have used this hair dryer about 10 times so far and I have to say.  It is an amazing bang for your buck!  I mainly got it as a back up dryer and then began my search for a high quality dryer in the $80-$100 price range.  I tried Solia 1875 ionic and the Rusk Speed Freak so far and both of them paled in comparison to this one.  It only has two heat settings but the high heat is perfect (not too hot, but not warm either).  This dryer is tourmaline & ceramic and I found i had more body and the same amount of shine with this one as I did with the Solia but the Solia made my hair very flat.  Not so with this dryer.  My hair has great body and doesn't get stringy or greasy the next day.  THe Rusk dried my hair to shreds (can you say horse hair???) and caused a lot of breakage.  I am sending both the high priced dryers back whence they came and keeping this one and will buy a 2nd one as a backup and I still saved about 50%!  Thanks Revlon & Thanks Amazon!  :)Update:  I still like this product but it didn't really calm my damaged broken bangs.  It left them frizzy and I think was contributing to the damage.  Every time I dried my hair my broken bangs would fly all over the place and stick up horribly.  I ended up buying a Babyliss 6600 dryer from Amazon and will use this as a backup.  It is very lightweight but I dont think it will hold up well.  Stick to Babyliss (more money but worth it if you have damaged, fragile hair).

  AFTER: First time using this product and it does work, have to build up a tolerance for the feel of it but it opens up the pores and makes the skin do what it needs to. Will make your face red after use but goes away within an hour (for me). I keep it cleaned with really hot water so bacteria does not build up and keep stored in container. I use it twice a week. Gives my face a nice clean glow.

  AFTER: I really love the size of the stick, and that it isn't gloppy and chunky like most mascaras that claim to have lengthening &#34;doll&#34; capabilities. I also LOVED how it worked for the first week of using it, but it dried out very quickly. I will add something to it to see if it brings it back to life. I'd like to try it again, as I really LOVED it at first.

  AFTER: The first thing I noticed about this soap was the incredible scent even before you open the package. most scented soaps have a nice smell once you take them out and sniff them with this one there is no need for that you can smell it without shoving it to you nose. The scent is not to strong though it is clean and fresh smelling. the scent stays on your skin in a light and clean way.This soap lathers nicely and is not gritty or sandy at all. this soap leaves you feeling fresh and clean and moisturized.

  AFTER: This product has a very pleasant, gentle and gender neutral scent and works great on my dry winter skin. I get most dry on my shoulders and legs and this stuff has really helped in a short period of time. Its such a great value I appreciate I can use it generously and know it will last a long time. Would highly recommend.

  AFTER: I am one of those who is constantly trying to find a new mascara that will both lengthen & thicken. I have found a handful that were doable, but most would clump or eventually flake. This stuff actually lengthens to where you can tell the difference, & seems to stay put.

UID: 23929
  BEFORE: <none>
  AFTER: This is a good product. (Olay's new professional products line is really very good.) It lasted almost all winter (3 months) because it doesn't take much to cover the face. It did give a descent result - but not a dramatic result. If you are looking for a dramatic change in the surface of your skin it would be best to go with a prescription product. (They can only sell up to a certain strength without a prescription.) I don't like Retin A. I don't want too much skin to peel off, and I don't like they dry flaking it can cause. After selling many different skin care lines for many years and experimenting with others I've learned not to try to do too much of a dramatic change to the skin at once and peel a lot of layers off. Better slow than sorry. We only get one face. So, I don't want to peel my skin off eliminating too many layers at a time. It just seems dangerous to me, and I've seen some really frightening results. (I'm not a dermatologist, but when I've seen others try to peel many layers off at once it looks as if they will scar.) I also think micro-dermabrasion hurts, but that is just me. I've only done it one time.

  AFTER: This oil is great for thinning areas along the hairline, and promoting softer and longer hair. It takes a little while to see results, but its worth the wait. I massage this stuff on my scalp every night and notice that my hair is thicker and softer after 2 months of use. It may be a little thick for some, but a good solution would be to mix it with another oil like coconut or jojoba.

  AFTER: I have used this in the past when I lived in the desert and it was great. I now live in San Antonio and the moisture seems heavy at times but my neck and chest love it. I continue to use the product just not as much alittle goes a long way.

  AFTER: There's a reason this one won the Allure &#34;Best of..&#34; award. It's smooth, truly clump-free, and fast drying without getting spike-y. I got black and the colour is not too harsh or artificial. Great purchase.

  AFTER: I have an expensive Ionic dryer that've use while at home. I was looking for an inexpensive dryer to take with me when I travel, and this is it. Not too big to pack, and it has all the qualities you need to dry your hair. It keeps the shine and dries my hair quickly.The Revlon 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ionic Lightweight Dryer features Tourmaline Ionic Technology for ultimate shine, volume, and healthier looking styles. This dryer has an ion indicator light, separate heat and speed switches, 2 heat/2 speed settings, cold shot button, hinged endcap, anti-skid bumpers, and concentrator and finger diffuser attachments. This ultra lightweight design is 25% lighter than my other dryer and has a sleek and upscale spray finish. This unit is super quiet and fast drying.Recommended. prisrob 05-03-14

  AFTER: This color is so pretty. It is full of gold glitter mixed with other colors of glitter to make it stunning. It looks really vibrant when looking at it on the brush, but is actually more see through than I was expecting when on the nail. I put on two coats and it is super sparkly, but more translucent than I prefer but love the color anyways. It is not super bold or flashy, a little more subtle. and is a great everyday color without being too bold

  AFTER: I read a review (not on Amazon) of this mascara.  Sounded good, so I checked to see if Amazon carries it.  They do, and I decided to try it.  I needed a new mascara, anyway.When I shop for mascara, I check out price, product, performance, and packaging.  I want a product that works well, costs little, and is packaged in a manner suitable for use and preserving the product.  I prefer non-waterproof mascaras, and I like lots of length and volume.  In other words, I'm demanding, and not so easy to please.When I received this, I thought at first I'd received old product because it is SO THICK, it appeared to be dry.  Usually when you open a new mascara, you'll see a bit at the end of the brush you need to wipe off before you start applying it.  No, that wasn't there.  I started putting it on anyway, and SHAZAM!  It does add incredible volume and length, plus, if you twist the wand upward and outward, it adds great curl.  At first I thought, oh, I have too much of this on, but the curl softens a bit.As far as volume goes, you can get it with Cover Girl Lash Blast in the orange tube, or the L'Oreal or Maybelline volumizing mascaras.  They're very good.  But THIS one gets the lower lashes, too, without clumping.This mascara does not flake or smudge.  Even when my eyes are watery from allergies, my mascara stays perfect all day long.  It will clump if you dawdle when you apply it.  Just go at it with confidence.  You can speedily add layers while simultaneously brushing out any clumps.I'm ordering this, or the lengthening version, again.  I haven't tried the lengthening version yet.  This is a great mascara.  It exceeded my expectations.  The only caveat I offer is that because it is so thick, it does take me a little extra time to remove it.  I dab on somePond's Deep Cleanser & Make-Up Remover with Cucumber Extractto soften it before washing my face.

  AFTER: I have tried just about everything- and I mean EVERYTHING (I worked in skincare for several years and was able to try hundreds of products for free)- and this is the one and only thing that 1) made any difference whatsoever on my pitted acne scarring (and a big difference at that)2) kept me from breaking out ONCE regardless of time of month or what I used on my face3) refined large pores and evened tone on my faceI couldn't believe how much it turned my skin around. I had redness, uneven tone, pitted scars and at least five or six blemishes at all times and after day two of using it, I had far less blemishes and less redness. By week two I had less scarring, smaller pores and no blemishes whatsoever. I have to say I've had NO issues with the quality of the product and I've used it every single day for two months. It still rolls just as well as it did the first time and it doesn't snag on skin at all. Works like new for me! The person who had problems with it probably just got a defective one, but neither of the two I've ordered have given me or my husband any problems.

  AFTER: Doll Eye (volume) goes on very nicely, separates my lashes, and provides the fullness I'm looking for in a mascara.I have sensitive allergy eyes that tend to run a lot, so I used to buy waterproof mascara to keep myself from looking like a raccoon by the end of the day.  Doll Eye stays on beautifully until I decide to take it off at night, even without buying the waterproof variety.Now I can have the volume I want without the mess.  I'm sold.Edit:  Ok so over time I found that this mascara dries out fairly fast, and gets clumpy along the way.  So the mascara I love becomes the ugly clump eyes shortly into the bottle.  It still wears fairly well, but I hate the look.My NEW favorite mascara isBenefit They're Real Mascara.  I've been using it almost exclusively for the past 6 months.  It's pricey but so worth it.  Sephora gave me a trial size for my birthday and it lasted a long time.  So if you want to try it out for a little less than a full tube costs, try the trial.  It's about half price of a full tube.  Also I think buying the smaller size is nice because you use it up before it has a chance to get "gloppy".

  AFTER: I've been using this for the past 2 days and am very happy with the results.The color is evenly distributed by the brush so that when I use my lash curler they look very full with none of those annoying globs of mascara you have to pull off or smooth away. My only complaint is that I wish the applicator was a little thinner for better control.  I have small fingers (like a lot of women) and it's kind of a pain using the brush on the bottom row of lashes.The color is a true black and I haven't had to do any touch-ups since I applied it 10 hours ago, and my lashes still look great.UPDATE:  1/30/13I just had to update my original review to 5 stars after using it for over 3 weeks.The brush separates my lashes each and every day without any clogging, clumping or flaking. I've used other brands that have cost less and some that have cost 4 times as much and have never had such consistant and exceptional results. I keep waiting for it to fail but it never disappoints.As someone who has always used an eyelash curler, I'm used to having to feather my lashes each time I curl them - but not with this mascara. Not once. I put it on, use my curler and I'm done.  And they look fabulous!And as for my original complaint about the applicator being to thick - forgive me for being an idiot.  Who cares about a little inconvenience for brief minutes when the results are outstanding and last for hours. Not me anymore.

  AFTER: As a fair-skinned lifelong Florida resident, former sun worshiper, and wife of someone who has had melanomas removed several times, I take protecting my skin from the sun fairly seriously.  Not just when I'm going to be out in the sun for extended periods of time, but even during a normal day when I'm only exposed to the sun while walking between buildings and cars.  Those rays really do affect the skin, even in small doses.  Because of that, a couple of years ago I started using a lotion with SPF 15 each and every day.  When I'm going to be out working in the yard or doing some activity that will mean longer exposure I'll use a stronger suntan lotion, but for the usual routine I think  SPF 15 is enough.But just because I want skin protection doesn't mean I want to smell like suntan lotion or feel like I've slathered myself with some kind of greasy goo.  The usual suntan lotions were not something I would be able to make myself use everyday so I went in search of a regular body lotion with SPF protection.  In the past I was using a Eucerin lotion and that wasn't too bad.  But it still had a little bit of a suntan-lotion-type of smell and felt a little weird on my skin so when the bottle started to run low I looked around for another brand to try.  I ordered this Aveeno lotion based on the reviews and ingredients.Well, I have to say the Eucerin is out and the Aveeno is in!  Very, very minimal fragrance that is nothing like suntan lotion, and it feels like normal body lotion on my skin.  The price is great and the 12 oz bottle is a generous size.  I'll probably order the larger size when I run out, I just wanted to start with something smaller to see if I liked it.  Now I just have to get the last bit of Eucerin out of the bottle (don't you hate it when the pump won't suck up the last inch of product in the bottom of the bottle?) and then I can switch to Aveeno full time.Oh - since I started using lotion every day my skin has been much softer, smoother, and generally looks and feels better and healthier.  My dermatologist is impressed. I can't give Aveeno or Eucerin credit for that, though, since I also use another brand's non-SPF lotion at night.  It's just a general statement for those who are lax on using a body lotion daily.  It's easy to forget to take care of the skin, especially the arms and legs, but it really does pay to keep it soft.Anyway, I do recommend the Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion with SPF 15.

  AFTER: it shipped fast, and was as promised.  i love that it's lightweight and can dry my thick, curly, long hair in about 10 mins (which is about 20 mins faster than my last blow dryer) without causing frizzies (when using the diffuser, which was included, along with a concentrator) or my arms needing a break.  the only time i've had my hair dried faster was at Gene Juarez with what i'm assuming is much more expensive equipment.  for under $30 i can live with the toggle buttons where they are.  i turned it off once by accident, and just repositioned my hand after that and it was not an issue.

  AFTER: Wow - a mascara that actually doesn't clump. This is a great product.The lengthening properties are exceptional! I wasn't expecting suchgood results, as mascaras don't usually live up to their claims.This one does - really lengthens without the clumps. I will definitelyre-purchase this item when I start running low. 5 stars to Covergirl!

  AFTER: I'm finding that more caster oils are becoming very useful. I've already had success with the likes ofHeritage Store Castor Oil, 32 Ounce, and the same thing can be said about this oil. For what its worth, I think this make for a good moisturizer. There doesn't seemed to have any major effects, but my skin does feel better after using this. I think its a great conditioner, so I recommend trying it.

  AFTER: I bought this Castor Oil strictly for any hair and skin benefits.  I do not have any scars, or stretch marks to test it on, but I can comment on any hair/scalp and skin benefits.My Hair condition:  Dry, course textured, thick, and color treated hair, (frizzy hair in both humid and dry climates) about an inch longer than shoulder length, with a small patch of itchy dry psoriasis in the back of my head.Facial Condition:  Dry skin, and since moving to the Southwest Desert, a very dry and acrid climate ...even drier skin.  I have reached my sixties, so with age; my skin has become challenging dry.Hair ChallengeMy first test object was my hair and scalp.  I decided not to brush my hair for the very first time ever, before shampooing.  I mixed 1/8 tsp. of castor oil in with a handful of my regular shampoo and lathered up.  I did not think that this could possibly be enough, but according to the other reviews that I had read, "a little tiny bit was supposed to go a long, long way."  My hair lathered up nicely, and then I rinsed.  I noticed four things immediately.1) Lose fall-out hairs were minimal - even though I did not brush my hair out first.2) That small patch of psoriasis was soothed - even though I did not use the medicated shampoo.3) No mats or tangles - even though I skipped the conditioner.4) My wet hair felt good, not slimy, not greasy, not oily, just a healthy hair feeling.I skipped my usual leave-in conditioner, and proceeded directly to the blow drier.Results:My hair dried a little faster than usual, and was incredibly soft, soft like a kitten or a puppy's fur.  My hairstyle finish was not quite as smooth or defined as I prefer, it came out a little too fluffy, but with the addition of a few spritzes of argon oil, the results were perfect.  Another bonus for me was that there were very few hairs left on my roll brush, only 4, or 5, which means that there was no hair breakage.  I usually pull an awful lot more hair off my roll brush when I am finished with the blow dry.  The final positive result was when I was out in the sunlight, my hair had a bit of a healthy, clean shine.  This is unusual for my hair because a thick, course textured head of hair does not generally have that characteristic, only my hairdresser can perform this miracle.Facial Challenge:As I have mentioned earlier in this review, I have very dry skin.  I applied a small amount of the castor oil on my face in the evening.  It is thick, and it is greasy, but this is what my dry skin requires because within an hour or so, the castor oil was completely absorbed.  I decided to lightly coat my face once more before bed.  In the morning, my face was a little dry, not sandpaper dry, as I have experienced in the past, but not that soft suppleness that I was hoping to achieve.  However, my skin texture and color was better and a little more even toned!In the other areas of my face that I have used this oil, I have seen some improvement.  My eyebrows are a little thicker, my lashes are luscious, and where I have been applying the oil nightly around the front fringes of my temple, there seems to be some thickening in some areas.  The little peach fuzz hairs around my hairline have not uniformly thickened in all areas, but I have not been using the oil for that long, and I have noticed that different areas respond at different time rates.  However, whatever improvement that been achieved has completely satisfied what little expectations that I have had in this area.I hope that my review has helped those who share my dry skin, facial, and hair issues.

  AFTER: Due to Hypothyroidism, my skin is very dry and requires constant moisturizing.  My feet are always super dry and on the verge of cracking at the heels no matter what I do.  I stumbled upon the Castor oil after ordering the Jojoba oil and thought "Why not".  My cabinets are full of expensive products that never worked and eventually are thrown in the trash.  It seems that Castor oil has many uses so I thought it couldn't hurt to give this a try and the price was right.  My feet no longer have the super dry and tight feeling and the cracking has gone away.  I didn't realize how tight the skin on my feet felt and how much discomfort it was causing.  I have started using this on my arms where I have age spots due to my sun loving lifestyle.  I could swear that the smaller spots have almost disappeared and the larger spots seem to be fading. The jojoba oil is great for my hair, but didn't do anything for my feet so it really takes the heavier Castor oil to get the results.

It dries my hair in five minutes, compared to twenty minutes with my old dragon dryer (you know the one, practically spits fire and weighs a ton!).  This does blow fast, even on low, but that is the great thing about it! The dryer is so LIGHT! 14.8 ounces to be exact! I just can't tell you enough about why I love it! The shipping was free, and the price was half what it is in the store.  If you have fragile hair, this is for you. If you have thick hair, this is for you. If you have frizzy hair, fine hair, any hair.. well you get the idea!

Finally I discovered Aveeno's moisturizing lotion, and I have had no problems with dry skin since. I apply it twice a day after my shower, whilst the skin is still moist, and the lotion glides on smoothly, absorbs into the skin, and lasts all day! It is really smooth, and in my opinion not really greasy. I dont even have to wash my hands after applying it. And its really good for my skin, the dryness has gone, and my skin feels smooth and conditioned. Highly recommended for dry skin sufferers!

I already had a Revlon Ionic hair dryer, but it was several years old, and worked just fine, but the price of this one was so reasonable I thought I would give it a try. Well what they said about the new ones was correct. This really does dry your hair in half the time. It is better for your hair, as it dries your hair with less heat! Not sure how that works, but it does. Highly recommend this product!

Be warned that this oil is thick and sticky (but I don't mind since it does the job).

  AFTER: I imagined that when I opened the bottle liquid would be so thick due to reviewers. Now, I believe those reviewers were new to the ideology of castor oil. I'm a Caribbean (Dominica W.I) woman who grew up using Jamaican black castor oil which is thicker than this. It's a good size for the price. But not as thick. So that's the only reason why I gave it 4 stars. Package is good. Smell is authentic castor oil. No issues other than its not that thick so I can tell I will run out fast if I don't mix it with something else.

  AFTER: Covergirl Clump Crusher Mascara delivers just what it promises -- there are no gross clumps in the finished look.You can go from daytime to a more dramatic look by layering the mascara on, and there are truly no clumps. Good thing for me, since I usually love to wear lots of mascara but hate those little globs you have to slowly remove with a cotton swab. Especially when you consider the price, this is a really good mascara that delivers just what Cover Girl promises.I will purchase this again, and certainly would recommend it to a friend.

  AFTER: This body wash makes a mild lather, and I can even use it for shaving. I like to use it on a nylon scrub puff and I find I don't have to use a moisturizing lotion after I shower or bathe, but it doesn't feel oily or greasy. The gel is rather thick, so it sits on the puff very well. It is a bit better in the shower than the tub, seems to leave a bit of a residue if you bathe. The scent is mild, like oatmeal or oatmeal cookies.I have allergies to a lot of things, sensitivity to most fragrances, especially strong perfumey ones, and bar soap leaves a residue (we have hard water.) This is a nice, mild body wash and leaves my skin very soft.One of the ingredients, in fact, the major ingredient, is sodium laureth sulfate, which is a detergent, somewhat less strong than sodium lauryl sulfate, and there is some feeling that shampoos and gels should be sulfate-free, but it is a good lathering detergent and seems to be mild enough.

My skin felt clean and refreshed. I used it in the shower, and it made the bathroom smell so good!I love that this soap has natural ingredients, making it great for your skin. If your skin is in need of more moisture, be sure to try this out. I'm in love with it!

  AFTER: I have hair down to my middle back so blow drying is always an extremely time consuming chore. Not anymore! With the concentrator attachment it takes me 5 minutes to dry my hair, 7-8 if I'm styling it using the blow dryer. The end of the dryer is a little warm after use, it won't burn you. But I do recommend letting it cool off on the counter for a couple minutes before putting it away.

  AFTER: After years of buying a $25 a tube mascara, I'm going back to Covergirl.  This mascara is pretty great.  The wand has very stiff ridges that comb through your lashes as you apply it.  It's basically impossible to clump.  It also gave my lashes great lift without having to use an eyelash curler, and even by the end of the day, my lashes were still lifted...that never happens.  The formula is thin, so if your looking for crazy volume, this isn't going to deliver.  But for extreme definition and lift, this mascara is fantastic.

This does not shrink at all.The only &#34;complaint&#34; I have isn't really a complaint, but is more to do with application and my learning curve. I applied the two color coats a little thicker on the first hand than the second and they look different. I wish I had noticed before I applied the top coat! Not sure if I can apply a color coat atop the cured top coat.I guess the good news is it's easy to apply thin coats to achieve different looks.Love this polish and color!

So I purchased this a few times when I see it other places. I love it! It really does give you Doll eyelashes. They are really pretty! There isn't much to be said for the volume as the consistency of the product is kinda thin. But, you could always layer it. I never have much luck with both volume and length (even from products that claim to do both). I have used Diorshow, Buxom, and Yves Saint Laurent mascara and this is right up there with them IMO. My only complaint is that I do get some flaking from it later in the day sometimes.

  AFTER: This has become my HG mascara. I love the original Covergirl Lashblast in the orange tube but wasn't a huge fan of the large wand since I have small eyes and lashes, so I decided to try this one for the wand alone. They don't lie when they say it doesn't clump. I'm one of those people that puts coat upon coat on to bulk up and darken my light, thin lashes and this one doesn't clump no matter how many times I coat (provided I don't let coats dry in between, but that's just common sense that you don't do that). I haven't had any problems with smudging on my eyelids or underneath my eyes despite getting the regular formula. I like that the brush isn't some gimmick-y contraption like alot of the wands being introduced lately. It's a sturdy brush that's slightly curved and fits the curve of the lashline to get all of the lashes easily, even the hard to get inside ones. I'll no doubt keep trying other mascaras because I can't help myself and i'm a sucker for clever marketing, but I will always have a tube of this on-hand in addition to any other ones I try. I hope they don't discontinue it anytime soon. That seems to happen with anything I really love.

  AFTER: I love Aveeno products and this is no exception.  It is an excellent exfoliant and is gentle on your skin.  It also has a very pleasant aroma and keeps you feeling fresh and rejuvenated.  It's ideal for when you get out of the bath.

  AFTER: I  rolled with it on my face yesterday and it was painful, but tolerable. I woke up this morning seeing a little improvement. I will use this twice a week and then once a month. I was going to try the chemical peeling, but glad I've decided to try this and if it fails me, I will then try the chemical peeling. The laser treatment is my last resort, so I need to save up in the future just in case.Update: Today was my 3rd time using this. My face do become red which is a good thing 'cause it means that I did it correctly..My few months old red marks faded! But not completely. I see improvement on acne scars. This thing is amazing and you should get it even if you don't have scars! Your skin will be smooth and you'll look younger.UPDATE #2: I've been doing the roller everyday, but I am only doing this for two weeks then I will start rolling my skin once a  week, then once a months. It does hurt a lot, but I don't care, I just do it. My skin turns red afterward which last a few hours. I don't have any active pimples and my dark spots on scars faded almost completely. I do see a small improvement on scars. I got a haircut which reveals most of my scarring and I didn't receive any comments about how awful my scars are.. instead, they said I look clean and that my skin is pale. They also said I look better.. but I don't think so.. I have more scars showing. I ordered the chemical peel to apply just on problem area.

  AFTER: I research a lot about before I purchased the roller , I got for 1.0 mm as my skin is still tick but have some 3 little scars from time when I was little kid that annoying me until today , well it get better , I am not sure if that are little swelling or the roller but they looks smoother , also the face skin improved after first use , it looks fresh all days long , also the pore size was dramatic smaller after couple of hours , I had red face like after sun burn for around 1 hour , I did not bleed like other due to my skin thickness but what I want was better blood circulation and it working so far , I heard also the pooping sound around the scars and dry areas from what I read it break the collagen so that was all good, I got some 3 mini blood drop on the forehead that is all after one hour everything was back to normal beside better skin showing up with radiant glow , be sure you buy the right length for your skin as each length will give you different result like 1.5  2 mm for the body  0.5 mm under eyes, 1.0mm on the face etc .. it is really great product and highly recommended if you have any problems with skin, acne, or dry, or fat , it seems to fix it in magical well understandable way , what don;t kill you make you stronger, and here is the exactly thing what it do, you hurt your skin in subtle way and skin regenerate faster and better leaving nothing else as smooth surface ..

  AFTER: I like this mascara a lot.  Love the black color and it really does not clump.  Handle is bulky but I do not find it to be an issue.  I like the curved brush too.  Will buy again - have bought three additional so far.

  AFTER: This mascara is billed as a no clump product, and I have found that to be true.  The brush allows the mascara to be applied lightly.  I consider this the perfect casual or office mascara, as it gives lashes some definition without an overdone look.  This is not the one to use, though, for a night out when you want a really "heavy" lash look.  Recommended.

  AFTER: I used to use Latisse, but it runs about $120.00 per month and, although I did see some improvement, it was not enough to justify the price. Then I discovered this product. After removing all makeup at night, I apply a bit to the lashes and lash line. I swear I see a difference - longer, thicker, and darker lashes. And it does not sting the eyes, or cause the slight skin discoloration that Latisse did.

  AFTER: I came across this tool accidentally, didnt even know something like this was on the market, and when i saw it i decided to give it a try, because what it does totally makes sense . I have been using it for a few months now , it is a little hard to get used to it in the beginning, because of the tingling sensation , and the needles, but once you get used to it and start to use it properly you will see the results, now i use it about 2-3 times a week, and my skin has a better appearance because of better absorption of the cosmetic product applied, but it has to be used and paired with good quality cosmetics

  AFTER: I liked the base coat better than the top coat I purchased from the same brand. The brush is shorter than a standard nail polish brush which I found helpful and more accurate. You don't need more than a thin layer of a base coat and it was a great price. Similar to the top coat by IBD it says to cure for 30 seconds using an LED lamp. It took almost 3 minutes to cure the base coat using my LED lamp

  AFTER: Right away when I took it out of the package you can smell such a wonderful scent. It's hard to describe but it was quite strong but not overbearing to where I didn't want to smell it. I actually kept it on my desk for a day and it was pleasant to catch whiffs of it before I used it.I took it in the shower and I loved the smell. The feeling of the soap bar on my skin was nice. There is just always something nice about a product that has minimal chemicals in it. I felt like it didn't leave that nasty soapy residue a bunch of cheap soap bars leave on your skin. I have to constantly apply deodorant throughout the day. I don't have a sweating problem but I my underarm sweat smells a bit. I have tried clinical strength deodorants but they barely work. I have been washing my underarms with this soap and I swear it helps out a TON. I have noticed my underarms don't smell that bad anymore. You know what would be awesome? I could only hope that Adovia comes out with their very own deodorant because I think it would be a big success. I totally recommend this dead sea salt soap bar because it moisturizes your skin. It makes you feel good after using it. I prefer to use this on my body and I also use the dead sea mud soap for my face especially. I think having both bars of soap have been quite beneficial to my skin's health. The benefits of dead sea salt are too great for anyone not to consider adding it to their daily skin care regiment.

  AFTER: I ordered the exact same product in two different colors. The bottle of pink gel was fine but this one...the brush was SO stiff, I cant even use it. I had to drop a glob onto the nail and smear it around. If it was a traditional polish, I could simply &#34;wash off&#34; the brush from another bottle but I don't think that is possible with gel. I wont be able to use this polish again because of the brush.

I feel fine about this product I just need to buckle down and use it more often.

  AFTER: This unit does not have a cool air option - only low or high heat settings(which is my reason for a 4 star rather than 5).  Works well and dries my hair quickly.

  AFTER: Very easy to use and is the perfect size for the face and hands.  Well spaced needles so that the needles penetrate properly and  doesn't scratch or drag across skin.  The needles are sharp and so far it's the most painless micro needle I've used so far.  This along with the derma stamp hopefully will be just what I need.** Please not that the great results after just one roll I learned were mainly due to micro-swelling. I've read that really good results come 3-6 months down the line.  However, I do like the micro-swelling because it lets me know that I'm rolling correctly and in the spots that I need.  The micro-swelling keeps the creases at bay and forces me to use other muscles in my face.  I would definitely do this a couple of days before an event I had to go to it's like a quick shot of botox that lasts about a week.**** UPDATE 04/26/13 I must advise those with areas of hyperpigmentation/melasma to NOT use on these areas too often.  I do have areas with hyperpigmentation, and I've found that it only darkened the area when used more than once in a couple of weeks.  I know that everyone's case of this is different, so my advice to you is to just use some caution and know that this might happen.  I also had some unusually bad stress during  this time, so it may have added to it.

  AFTER: My wife and I both love this wash.  Wife is super skeptical about trying new products for fear of being allergic to them, but loves this wash.  Lathers up very nice, and unlike some other washes half of what you put in your hand doesn't fall off onto the shower floor.  Leaves our skin far more moisturized than other washes, and moisturizing bars, that we've used.

  AFTER: I tried this as well as the regular castor oil, I love them both but would probably prefer this one over the other one. This one cost a couple of dollars more but it works better in my opinion. I have natural hair and my edges were thinning from a hairstyle that I had that was too tight, this grew my edges back almost completely in 45 days, I could see some growth after 2 days. I also put this on my eyebrows for fullness and have friends that rub a little on their eyelashes. I had no problems with shedding like I have read in other reviews. This is my 3 bottle that I have ordered. The only slight problem I had was a small amount of leakage when shipped.

  AFTER: I saw the ad from Olay claiming that this cream was as good as $500 creams, so I went and purchased one. But the scent is truly way too strong. It smells like I'm putting on perfume! I use Shiseido Future Solution LX Night Cream ($220) and this cream does not even come close to what it claims (as good as $500 creams), it can't even match Shiseido's which is 1/2 as expensive. Truly a let down, especially with the really strong scent for a cream. If this was a lotion, I would expect the scent to be strong, but for a facial cream, the scent is overpowering and feels like it belongs on the body, not on the face. It makes the cream feel very cheap and substandard.

  AFTER: While I occasionally splurge on Buxom Lash mascara, my tried and true mascaras seem to be the newer series of Cover Girl ones that have come out in the last few years orAlmay One Coat Get Up and Grow Mascara, Black, 0.21-Ounce.  While some folks hate the large brush and tube of these newer ones, I don't mind them, and I love the new bristle brushes that coat without leaving clumps.  I've already had good luck using the regular Lash Blast (the one in the orange tube), but I thought I'd try this new one to see how it works.  I really like it, and it really does leave zero clumps!The curved brush on this also does a nice job of adding a gentle curl to your lashes. The non-waterproof formula stays put, even when my allergies are acting up and my eyes are teary.I bought this in the Very Black color, and it's still natural-looking.Like all Cover Girl mascaras, this also comes off easily, with just some eye makeup remover or face wash and water.  You don't have to tug or pull at your eyes.It's a keeper!

  AFTER: This soap smells nice and soaps up well.  It does not clog my pores or dry out my skin either.  My only complaint is that it does not moisturize as well as a body wash.  The soap, as with all bar soaps I have used, leaves a tight, almost draggy feeling on my skin.  Therefore, I would pick a body wash over the bar soap formula.

I usually use shea butter but because it is summer time I have to put the shea butter up until the winter.  OMG my hair is amazing and lovely.  Black Castrol works it works.  My edges are back and thick now and I have natural dark coloured jet black hair and it has help the shine in the hair. yes it is thick and the smell may not be to your liking but at the end of the day your hair will thank you bc hair needs natural ground earth products. ALSO you must eat healthy as well and exercise your hair needs that too. YOU MUST GET THIS.  You will not be disappointed. UPDATE!!! It is has been a year since I started using Black Castrol Oil and I STILL USE IT!!! What an awesome product!! My hair is extremely longer, thicker and healthier.  In the process I tried other products and ummmm no no ... does not compare.  I know people complain about the smell but it doesn't matter it works that is what matters.

  AFTER: I wasn&#8217;t quite sure what to expect from the Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap. And I thought it would be gritty and exfoliating, but it wasn't it is a very soft soap. The scent lingers on your skin but is not at all overpowering. It&#8217;s a very pleasant and clean scent. Since the scent is pretty much a clean neutral scent men can use this product. The soap is smooth and lathers beautifully. There&#8217;s nothing gritty or rough about it. It&#8217;s almost like a lotion which is how I like my soap to feel . After a few days of using it I noticed that it cleared up some patches of rough skin and acne that I often get. So often soaps dry out my skin but this one has not done that. It dose not leave behind a  film or residue and my skin feels soft and not dry or rough I&#8217;m very pleased with this soap. Adovia made a great product. The Adovia Dead Sea Salt soap has done all it promised to do, all while leaving a pleasant and clean scent on my skin. This infused soap is one I&#8217;m glad I had a chance to use. The price when compared to similar products, is really reasonable! A lot of these infused soaps cost almost twice what Adovia is selling their product for. This soap is absolutely worth every penny.

  AFTER: Got it in the mail yesterday and put it to work last night. Reviewers who said it was painful were not joking. I have a high pain tolerance but man, that thing HURTS. I was really fighting back those tears! I also had to take mini-breaks.I tried not to add any pressure but then the wheel wouldn't spin and the needles ended up scratching my face. Imagine rubbing a cactus on your face. OUCH!! So I put just enough pressure to get the roller going and it kept squeaking big time. Did not sound good. I wished the roller was better lubricated so I wouldn't have to use ANY pressure. Then it wouldn't have been so bad. Maybe that's why some people are saying it didn't hurt?My face got red and warm,just like a sun-burn. I was kind of scared at first because I read (afterwards) that it can cause melasma and hyperpigmentation to darken. I was hoping to LIGHTEN melasma/hyperpigmentation, some very fine lines and very few acne scars. Next time I 'll go a lot easier on the pigmented areas and focus more on the lines and scars. Hopefully I can stir up enough courage to do this again in a couple of weeks.Woke up this morning and my face felt soft but dry and warm. It was still red and felt like a sun-burn. Put on all natural moisturizing/repair serums and sunscreen after my morning shower. Up close my face still looked painful but from a distance I had a really nice "sun-kissed glow." It was quite pretty. Like I was wearing a really pretty blush.Well that's all I can say about this roller for now. Hopefully once my face heels fully, I'll see and feel a little more improvement.

This does not shrink at all.The only &#34;complaint&#34; I have isn't really a complaint, but is more to do with application and my learning curve. I applied the two color coats a little thicker on the first hand than the second and they look different. I wish I had noticed before I applied the top coat! Not sure if I can apply a color coat atop the cured top coat.I guess the good news is it's easy to apply thin coats to achieve different looks.Love this polish and color! Will purchase again and look forward to trying other IBD polishes.

  AFTER: IBD Just Gel is a great gel polish for a great price.  The bottles are large and I have never had any issues curing them with my uv lamp.  I use them with Gelish Foundation and Top it Off.  My babe is a pale lilac/lavender color. Eden is a bold (almost) kelly green. Smokey Plum is between a grey and light purple color-the name says it all.  Cosmic Red is packed with red glitter in a red jelly base. Like ruby red slippers. I prefer it layered over a creamy red.  Bing Cherries is a true, fire engine red. This brand has always worn well for me. 2-3 weeks no chipping. (When applied and removed correctly, there will be no damage to the natural nail.)

  AFTER: Everyone's got a clump-free mascara these days, but most don't live up to their advertising.  This one actually does.  The well-designed brush has a curve that allows easy swiping of both upper and lower lashes without a single eye-poke.  That's key.  Many makers have tried brush shapes that, while they apply a lot of product, sometimes without clumps and sometimes with just a few small ones, there's either a poke factor or an angulation that's hard for even the most deft to achieve, let along arthritic older types like me.  This is easy, the product covers nicely with little effort, and there are no gyrations involved in application.  Until something better comes along, I'll call this the Best of Show.

  AFTER: I was contacted to try and review this soap, and I jumped on the opportunity.  I've used Adovia products in the past, and was always so happy with the results.When I received this soap in  the mail, and opened it up, I found myself wanting to try it immediately.  The scent of this soap is just wonderful.  I love walking into my bathroom, and getting a whiff of the soap.  It's such a clean, spring-like scent.After using it for about 2 weeks, I noticed a big change with my skin.  So far, I've only used it on my face. It has left my face feeling super soft and help tremendously with my combination skin.  I struggle with dry skin around my nose and cheeks. This bar has really helped clear that issue up.Anyone who is looking to brighten up their complexion should give this soap a try.  I have noticed not only a brighter complexion, but a smoother complexion.  It's my new favorite facial cleanser.Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.

  AFTER: Want long, voluminous, non-clumpy lashes? Look no further. This mascara is amazing! I have long lashes already. I wanted something that emphasizes that more and gives a lot of volume. This does exactly that. And the lashes are nicely separated and not clumped together making it look like I have 5 really thick eyelashes. The only thing I dislike is that it's quite difficult to get off, even with using an eyemakeup remover. It's quite a task at the end of the day to get it off completely because I put on many coats.

  AFTER: Although I really like several of the NYX mascaras, this one is my favorite.  It goes one without clumping, makes my lashes look dark and lovely, and l-a-s-t-s!  It doesn't run, but comes off easily with cleaners and water.

  AFTER: It definitely does what it is supposed to do, I'll say that. It has an added bonus. It makes me sneeze my head off when rolling it over my forehead. Strange effect. -laugh- I've known a lot of people to use these and then complain that they broke their skin out only to find out they were not sanitizing it. Gross. Sanitize it, people.

  AFTER: This large handheld hair dryer is loud and takes a little too long to dry hair. I've had smaller ones that were more powerful and less noisy, but went for it because it looked like a bargain. If the diffuser attachment is important to you, that could cinch the deal. I found the attachment to be entirely ineffective, but it might work if you drape really long hair onto it.Ionic - this product is marketed as ionic. It has an ion indicator light. The Revlon website doesn't list this product, and I couldn't find anywhere a claim to the effect that it imparts a negative charge to the air. It's reasonable to expect Revlon to state whether it has an emitter and leaves only negative ions in the exhaust.Unfortunately, quality handheld hair dryers cost a lot more. You have to look at this as a value purchase, and because it's so large, you should have the space for it.

  AFTER: I really think this stuff does exactly what I hoped it would. It seems my hair has grown & thickened within like maybe 2-3 weeks of using this oil. However, I must say I also took advice of previous commenters by taking my biotins in conjunction. So, to say the castor oil alone has grown & thickened my hair would probably be a bit exaggerated. Also, the other reason I got this stuff was to regrow out my fairly thin edges on the left near my temple...can't say I've really seen any improvement there.Other things you should know I do that may have helped/hendered speed of growth, length or luster:*I'm a believer in dirty hair grows best, so I grease my scalp like 1x a week & wash maybe 1x every month or 2. lol, Some of you may think that is so disgusting but, I don't get out enough for it to be all that bad.*I basically diluted my castor oil (like a 1/4 castor to like 1/2 a tube of doo grow hair oil/grease)*I take biotin by Natures Bounty 5000mcgand...*I try not to wear my hair tied up so much. I use clamps, pins or what have you. Staying away from tying up my hair is beneficial sense it is reason I have slightly balding on my edge(s). This is also good to help prevent breakage of hair allowing proper, healthy growth.Thanks Tropic Isle makers, I'm excited to see my hair length & luster will be like in the coming future.(with continued use of your product, of course. LOVE THE VALUE. Of Course, I WON'T BE MAD IF IT'S MADE CHEAPER, price wise :-)

  AFTER: Bought this because I wanted to replace Too Faced Lash Injection Pinpoint since its become so hard to find and dries out too fast for the price. The mascara itself is great but I don't get the brush (sort of a curvy hourglass shape--why??). This might just be me because I've been using the incredibly shallow bristles of the pinpoint mascara for years and I like to work in my mascara a little thicker at the base of my lashes instead of bothering with eyeliner most days. I find it very difficult to apply this evenly without a few smudges on my eyelids. It CAN be a little spidery.Best aspect: it doesn't smudge or run when my eyes water, when I yawn a billion times a day, when I sweat or when my skin gets oily. It does smush in a gooey way if I cry and rub my eyes, but that's much better than flaking or running. I live in Savannah, Georgia and it has no trouble with the humidity. I've also slept in it a few times without it smudging or running at all, which is amazing.

  AFTER: It is well worth every penny of it's price. My skin is starting to feel and look amazing since using this soap. It smells nice and rinses away clean too. I've also been using it as a morning scrub moisturizer for my face and it is proving to be very beneficial in that way as well

  AFTER: I've been using this mascara the past week or so, and the nice thing is that it has not clumped, so that is great. But it doesn't seem to volumize my lashes at all. It also seems just a little sticky to me. When I put it on, I often have to use my finger tips to separate some of my lashes that stick together as I am applying it. That is always a pet peeve of mine when it comes to mascara, so for that, I just can't give it five stars. But it is not clumping, they are true to their word about that point. I am still looking for an inexpensive mascara that doesn't make lashes stick together, clump, or run if your eyes water a little, and that can add a little volume and length.

  AFTER: This hair dryer is the third in a series of attempts to find the right hair dryer for my wife, who has long thick hair.  The first one was a Vidal Sassoon that had ionic technology, but didn't get near hot enough.  She was drying her hair for > 20 minutes.The second attempt was the Revlon RV469 ceramic, which was much quieter and got hotter, but didn't have much air flow.  Also, it is quite heavy.  It was better than the first dryer, but not hair drying nirvana.This dryer (Revlon RV544) has easily cut my wife's drying time in half.  She has very thick & long hair, and the high heat setting makes quick work of it.  It gets hot enough that I actually tone it down to warm for myself (I have short, thick hair) whenever I have to use the dryer.  I think the air flow settings are perfect.  The dryer is also nice and light, and fits in a bathroom drawer easily, unlike some of the bulkier models out there.My wife thinks this is the best dryer she has ever had.  We highly recommend it.

  AFTER: I have been meaning to try this Olay product ever sinceGood Housekeeping (1-year auto-renewal)tested it, and said it was better than a $500 cream they also tested.  Well, either they changed the ingredients in this product, or I don't have the same skin type the testers had, because this cream did nothing but make my skin look duller.  It was too thick.  Now, on toOlay Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Cream, 1.7 Ouncefor two months . . . .

  AFTER: I have been using the oil cleansing method for facial cleansing and moisturizer for over a year.  I have been happy with the results.  I decided to try adding this to my mix.  And I love it.This castor oil is thick.  I only add a little to the other oils.I also add it to the jojoba oil I put on my hands and elbows.  I have eczema and my skin doesn't react well to most lotions.  But this seems to work really well.I love the bottle.  I know that seems like an odd thing to say, but with oils I tend to find they use inappropriate caps and lids.  and the oils spill, leak, or pour out.  This lid is perfect for this oil.  you can squeeze out a bunch or just drip one tiny drop.

  AFTER: This is a great product as all IBD gel polishes are in my personal experience. When it arrived I thought it would be neon pink (the label and the polish look like that) and I wasn't happy about that but once I put it on my nails it was hot pink instead, which was exactly what I was looking for!! It also has a shimmery look to it but you can only notice it in the sunlight (outside). I did 2 coats to achieve that hot pink look, maybe if you do 3 it will look more neon? I don't know... But overall I'm super happy with the color and the purchase. I wanted to upload a pic of my nails with this gel polish but didn't know how to do it on my phone :(

  AFTER: Sometimes I skip foundation, sometimes I skip eye shadow... I NEVER skip the mascara. It's the one item of make up I truly care about wearing. (Well, that and lip gloss. Anyway...)This mascara is amazing. Though I haven't tested it in the rain- I CAN say that it is long lasting. I worked a 14 hour day and was too exhausted to take off my make up before hitting the sack, when I woke up in the morning my mascara still looked great. I haven't tested it in the rain yet, buttt it comes off very easily with some generic make up remover I have. (The easier it comes off, the better, for me.)This mascara does not clump. I love it. My eyelashes look long and silky- they don't look like gross spider legs with this stuff. No flakes, no smudges. Highly recommend this one!

Who needs to take a trip to the spa when you can exfoliate and leave your skin feeling smooth and clean and refreshed at home! This soap didn't feel like any soap i've ever used before.

  AFTER: I don't believe there are any miracles in face creams, despite what the marketers would like us to believe.  At 62, I swear I have tried everything in the department stores, including Creme de la Mer, and most of what is in the drugstore.  What it finally came down to was something that was adequately moisturizing but not greasy, and above all, non-irritating.  My favorite daily moisturizer is the Regenerist Serum without fragrance, and I use this one at night because it is heavier and a good moisturizer for the night.  This cream is soothing, non-irritating despite having a bit of fragrance (hardly any).  I'm quite pleased with it, and will buy it again.  Is it as good as a $150 face cream?  I'd say yes, it is.  Olay also makes many of the big department store brands, by the way.  I've bought Lancome, Lauder, Chanel, Clinique, many others, and with many I had skin irritations, couldn't use them and returned them.So this cream meets my criteria for a good face cream and the price is right!  I use the Olay Pro-X cleansing brush at night, followed by this cream and my skin looks great, I don't know of anything better than this cream and you certainly don't need to spend more.  As for the "micro-sculpting" aspect of it...don't believe it.  If you want to improve your skin, use Retin A, good sunscreen, moderate your drinking of alcohol, don't smoke, and take good care of your skin by cleansing it properly and moisturizing when necessary (it gets more necessary as you get older).  I can say for a fact that what you do in your youth determines how your skin looks when you get older.  If you severely damage your skin, there are no miracle creams out there, don't get fooled into believing that.

I am not a fan of the scent.On recommendations of friends I tried the skin cream again, and within a week I found my skin breaking out at my chin line. I have not had issues with my skin since I was a teenager, some 50 odd years ago. I was aghast. I stopped using the cream, and my skin cleared within a few days.I must add that my daughter uses Olay Regenerist Cream, and she loves it. So, who knows what the problem is with my use. I per used other reviews just now, and found other women have had the same skin issues I have.

  AFTER: Aging baby boomers, my wife and I don't get out as much as we once did, but we do still go out occasionally. My wife has always used very light makeup, but she still uses mascara to highlight her eyes and long lashes. When she developed a slight tremble in her hands a couple of years ago, she was concerned about applying mascara for fear of injuring her eyes, so I volunteered to apply it. Surprisingly, she accepted my offer. One of her biggest gripes about mascara is its tendency to clump and look messy, so she was glad to try Clump Crusher.The product comes in a sealed bottle with a separate brush that you can see through the packaging. The brush is slightly curved at the applicator end, which has dozens of very fine bristles about 1.5 mm long. The round brush's handle is about 0.9" in diameter, which makes it easy to hold. That's the obvious stuff.In use, we both appreciated how the fine bristles separated and coated her lashes evenly with no noticeable clumping. I applied one coat of the mascara to both her eyes around noon yesterday, then we left the house for about seven hours to deliver Christmas presents and have dinner at a restaurant. When we returned, we both examined her eyes and found no smudging or flaking, even with a few tears shed at one stop. Later that evening, my wife removed the mascara with a washcloth and warm soapy water. It removed fairly easily with no visible traces left.Overall, the Covergirl Clump Crusher Mascara appears to be a fine product that works as advertised. My wife is sold on the product.

  AFTER: I am 37 and starting to get those fine laugh lines and "crows feet".  I decided to give this a whirl.  While I like the unscented version better, the scented is still nice and not offensive; I have gotten creams in the past which are just too offensive and give me a headache.  My husband had commented on the earlier creams and for this one he hasn't said a word! (Not to mention the earlier ones did not work though I cannot remember, for the life of me, what they were; obviously I was not impressed.)The scented version has a light, non-offensive odor.  The unscented version has no odor (imagine that).  Regardless, they both do reduce fine lines!I was using it for about a week (8 days maybe?) before I saw a difference.  My fine lines were finer and less noticable.  (Probably no one but I noticed them before I started using this but it made me feel better and that is the point, isn't it?)And, when I got them, the exfoliating face-wash was being sold with it for half off.  And that is also a great product.I recommend this for anyone with light crease lines and who wants to keep their skin rejuvenated! I also highly recommend that you use the Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub Face Wash, as aforementioned.  I will also review that!

I'm Asian and my hair is a very dark brown with a reddish warm hue, so even though subtle, the blackest black shades just looked a bit artificial. This Black Brown shade is amazing. I love that my makeup looks softer, more natural, and without any clumps in sight - are they natural? Is she wearing mascara? I love it. The brush is just perfect, too - very rarely make mistakes and I manage to get every hair I want to. Sometimes reaching the hairs near the corners can be frustrating with other types of brushes, but this gets every one, and I don't end up with clumps in the process!

I read on WebMd that the active ingredient in this lotion is actually what helps heal dry skin so I gave it a shot.  That was almost 3 years ago.  I use this all over my body, but even more so I use it on my face because that is the only place I have a problem with dry skin, especially in the winter.  Target sells this size bottle for $10.99+ (and on numerous occasions it has been out of stock)but with Amazon's super saver subscription I get it delivered on time every 2 months for a cheaper price.

  AFTER: This bar soap is very moisturizing and lathers up really nicely. It's perfect for anyone with dry or normal/dry skin, since it hydrates so well. The bar itself is a nice thick size - bigger than most other bar soaps I have used - so it will last quite awhile. I'm usually not a fan of bar soaps since they tend to leave my skin dry, but this soap is as moisturizing and sudsy as a body wash cream. And the best part is that it contains natural ingredients from the earth.At first I was just using the soap on my body in the shower, until I realized I should be using it on my face too, as the directions state. I always get kind of nervous when trying new cleansers on my face and I've never tried a facial bar soap before, but man, this one really impressed me! I have sensitive skin and didn't have any irritation or redness, like I usually do after washing my face. I could feel all the dry skin being washed away, and it looks like it helped clear out my pores as well. This soap rinsed away easily and left my face feeling super clean and soft. I'm so excited to finally have a soap that doesn't leave my face red after using it! It's gentle and moisturizing, which is exactly what I need.

  AFTER: The soap smells amazing. Very fresh, very clean and not overpowering. It does not  get soggy in the shower after use. Something that I love because I really detest soaps that melt due to moisture and the mess it creates. This soap lathers a lot. Another thing I love. And it washes off easily and doesn't leave any residue so we know for sure impurities are being washed off. I have definitely seen an improvement with the acne on my skin. It has not fully disappeared but it has started clearing up. The redness is easing and those that did scare are lightening. The soap does not give me any extra moisture, so I still resort to my lotion application process of coconut oil and then my regular body lotion as normal.I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.

  AFTER: This mascara separates the lashes well, but it's very stiff going on and hurts my lashes and eyelids when I apply it.  I even put a little saline in it to try to soften up the formula a little (pinterest trick!), but it didn't seem to help much.  It gives good definition, but I wouldn't want to use it everyday.

  AFTER: I have tried several different products by Adovia and seriously love them all. This particular bar of soap has a strong, but good, clean scent. It works very well on my face and body as far as keeping my skin moisturized. This actually surprised me because I usually don't use bars of soap on my body because normally they dry my skin out and leave soap scum residue. This soap does neither of those things. It lathers up very well too. I love to use this on my legs after I shave so that not only are they clean, but they are also super soft. The moisture and softness lasts too. I was a tiny bit worried that after using regularly my skin might finally start to dry out, but nope! It continues to moisturize day after day.One other thing that did surprise a bit was the fact that although it is another dead sea salt product, it doesn't necessarily do anything for my acne when I break out. Their dead sea mud soap does though so I switch to that when I do break out.I do like this soap a lot anyway. I find that it works best when rubbed onto a loofah, when it gets super lathery and bubbly and then I rub it in a circular motion all over. On my face I use a konjac sponge with it and love the way it feels afterward. Wonderful product. Highly recommended especially for the colder months when your skin might dry out the most.I was sent a free product since I am a product tester, in exchange for my honest review. All opinions expressed are solely my own.

  AFTER: I take a lot of pride in my appearance. I have used all sorts of creams for my face but the one I always go back to is Olay. I have been using it since my early 20's and am now in my late 50's. If you do the research like I have you will find Olay Regenerist in the top 10 of all other moisturizers along with the most expensive ones. No one believes I'm my age and even had people want to see my drivers license to prove it. You can't go wrong with Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream. I can't live without it. This is a 5 star plus rating for me. Try it and see the difference it makes.

  AFTER: First off, let me say I am not in any way benefitting from this review.....I was amazed at the results.  A little about myself: I'm 40 and have recently (intentionally) lost over 30 pounds, have had a stressful last six months, and have an expressive face (I wrinkle my eyebrows a lot). So I started to notice creases above my eyebrows.  Stress, weight loss, and my continued eye wrinkling started to show. Ugh.  I can't afford medical intervention, but knew that I needed to do something. Just like everyone else ... I had seen the Olay commercials. I'm a natural born skeptic and hate to waste money.  $20-- ok, worth a try.I used the cream (light, non greasy, lovely) one night before bed. The forehead creases are noticeably diminished after only one day's use. I looked more rested and fresh faced.  I was completely surprised. I am anxious to see what a week's worth of use will do.

  AFTER: This mascara is billed as a no clump product, and I have found that to be true.  The brush allows the mascara to be applied lightly.  I consider this the perfect casual or office mascara, as it gives lashes some definition without an overdone look.  This is not the one to use, though, for a night out when you want a really "heavy" lash look.  Recommended.

I am always looking for soap that not only cleans my skin but also leaves it soft, hydrated and doesn't leave a film on my skin. The product met all my requirements! I love feeling like I am treating my skin with spa quality products. The more I learn about Dead Sea minerals the more love this product! I love the fact that Dead Sea salt contains 21 minerals key minerals for skin health and beauty. A must have!Disclosure: I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion.

  AFTER: Review by Tom's wife.Love the smell & texture of this cream. However, I do not feel that it's hydrating enough for my dry skin. Maybe I should use it with the Regenerist serum. Strangely, I find the Olay Total Effects creams more hydrating.*Update: From 3 stars to 4 stars. I've been using this for approx. 2 weeks every evening now. Originally, I didn't think this cream was that great. I decided to leave my skin slightly damp before applying. I find this makes the product go on more smoothly. So, now my skin feels more hydrated. :)

  AFTER: This has become my HG mascara. I love the original Covergirl Lashblast in the orange tube but wasn't a huge fan of the large wand since I have small eyes and lashes, so I decided to try this one for the wand alone. They don't lie when they say it doesn't clump. I'm one of those people that puts coat upon coat on to bulk up and darken my light, thin lashes and this one doesn't clump no matter how many times I coat (provided I don't let coats dry in between, but that's just common sense that you don't do that). I haven't had any problems with smudging on my eyelids or underneath my eyes despite getting the regular formula. I like that the brush isn't some gimmick-y contraption like alot of the wands being introduced lately. It's a sturdy brush that's slightly curved and fits the curve of the lashline to get all of the lashes easily, even the hard to get inside ones. I'll no doubt keep trying other mascaras because I can't help myself and i'm a sucker for clever marketing, but I will always have a tube of this on-hand in addition to any other ones I try. I hope they don't discontinue it anytime soon. That seems to happen with anything I really love.

This is pretty typical length for Gel polishes on me and I am very happy with that time frame.You need an LED or UV light and you cure for 30 seconds.  You also need a PH bond, Foundation/Base and a Topcoat to cure in the Light as well.

I am big on waterproof the fusion lasts better and gives a bit more volume and is water resistant, which is not up to my holy grail mascaraBenefit Cosmetics BADgal Lash Mascarabut does add a bit more staying power. clump crusher will stay well, but don't get caught in the rain.

  AFTER: Seriously doubt the claims that it is Tourmaline, Ionic and Ceramic.  There is not switch for Ionic (as described) and the nozzle is at sort of an odd angle from the handle, not 90 degrees like most hairdryers.  The photo makes it look as if it is but it's more like 80 degrees, which makes awkward to direct it at your hair in some positions when using a round brush.  Dosen't seem to dry any faster than a non-specialized dryer.  Not my favorite.

  AFTER: I was contacted to try and review this soap, and I jumped on the opportunity.  I've used Adovia products in the past, and was always so happy with the results.When I received this soap in  the mail, and opened it up, I found myself wanting to try it immediately.  The scent of this soap is just wonderful.  I love walking into my bathroom, and getting a whiff of the soap.  It's such a clean, spring-like scent.After using it for about 2 weeks, I noticed a big change with my skin.  So far, I've only used it on my face. It has left my face feeling super soft and help tremendously with my combination skin.  I struggle with dry skin around my nose and cheeks. This bar has really helped clear that issue up.Anyone who is looking to brighten up their complexion should give this soap a try.  I have noticed not only a brighter complexion, but a smoother complexion.  It's my new favorite facial cleanser.Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.

  AFTER: I've been using this for the past 2 days and am very happy with the results.The color is evenly distributed by the brush so that when I use my lash curler they look very full with none of those annoying globs of mascara you have to pull off or smooth away. My only complaint is that I wish the applicator was a little thinner for better control.  I have small fingers (like a lot of women) and it's kind of a pain using the brush on the bottom row of lashes.The color is a true black and I haven't had to do any touch-ups since I applied it 10 hours ago, and my lashes still look great.UPDATE:  1/30/13I just had to update my original review to 5 stars after using it for over 3 weeks.The brush separates my lashes each and every day without any clogging, clumping or flaking. I've used other brands that have cost less and some that have cost 4 times as much and have never had such consistant and exceptional results. I keep waiting for it to fail but it never disappoints.As someone who has always used an eyelash curler, I'm used to having to feather my lashes each time I curl them - but not with this mascara. Not once. I put it on, use my curler and I'm done.  And they look fabulous!And as for my original complaint about the applicator being to thick - forgive me for being an idiot.  Who cares about a little inconvenience for brief minutes when the results are outstanding and last for hours. Not me anymore.

  AFTER: I have tried a lot of skin care products lately and I am very skeptical about any new ones because I use most of them once and never open again. Most of them make me break out, leave me to dry or oily, or simply don't work. I gave this one a try after seeing all of the positive reviews. My skin is sensitive to fragrances and I did not have a problem with this one. I have found this is light enough to use in the morning before makeup and at night after cleansing. It really has improved the texture and smoothness of my skin. It also has minimized my combination skin "freakouts". I tend to get dry and oily at the same time on different areas of my face and this really helps balance it. It doesn't cake up on your skin or make it feel greasy and heavy. This will remain in my beauty regimen for a long time to come. To anyone who is on the fence about trying it, just try it once and you will love it too!

It is a little pinchy on the skin when you roll it, (sometimes it makesme sneeze when I do between the brow area)  but it opens up my pores and lets the product absorb down into the skin so effectively!!  My skin is luminous when I go to bed and refreshed in the morning when I awake.  I love it, It is of good quality and the price was FANTASTIC! I am hooked.

  AFTER: Want to revitalize you face and skin tone? Look into products that utilize Dead Sea Salt. It is amazing. This bar of soap feels great. Doesn't give the residue after effect that a lot of infused soaps do so I really appreciate that. Plus, the exfoliation benefits are tremendous and instantly noticeable. I am loving Dead Sea Salt products and will keep trying more options that come available.

  AFTER: Bought this to toss in my bag for use at work and on the go. The product rubs in easily and is not greasy on the hands. I work constantly with paper at my job and also tend to wash my hands more often than most. Both of these activities tends to dry out hands and this lotion has been a real skin saver for me. I no longer have cracked skin with bloody knuckles from the drying paper and soap from washing. Small enough that I can keep one in my desk and one in my purse or backpack.

  AFTER: I am very pleased to use this oil. I heard great reviews about castor oil when it comes to natural hair. So I wanted to give it a go, being a "natural products only" type of gal. After deep conditioning and washing with black soap, I went with my usual routine and applied my Kinky Curly leave-in, and instead of purely jojoba, I used jojoba combined with castor oil on soaking wet, freshly washed hair with the leave-in. The result: no sealing in the moisture when my hair is 90% dry! The castor oil is heavy enough to lay down the cuticle layer on the hair shaft down, acting as a sealant. Just like sealing with a butter, except lighter! Lighter means your hair moves more easily. I don't actually need shea butter to seal in my hair now, because this is able to replace it. However I love my shea butter, and I won't give it up without a fight! ;)I now oil my ends with castor oil daily, and my hair seems stronger. I thought I had virtually no breakage then, but NOW its amazing. No breakage at all, hair is shiny, stays moisturized longer, and it helps my skin too. Highly recommend for dry, unruly hair, or dry skin. Tip: More is less with this stuff! You only need 1-2 drops, so it will last a long time.EDIT:1 year later, I am just now purchasing my second  bottle of castor oil. It really lasts. I apply castor oil (2-3 drops per section) to my hair after misting with water mixed with kinky-curly knot today and various oils.(Or after a co-wash)  Prevents breakage, retains the moisture, acts as an emollient for skin and hair, giving hair that luster and skin a fresh glow. I dont use too much because it leaves a greasy feeling. So, dont over-do it. Add essential oils to mask its natural scent, as its a bit funny on its own. I love ylang ylang. Almost forgot to mention, castor oil is wonderful for protecting the skin and hair in winter. My skin and hair have improved after continuous use of castor oil. Will never NOT BE in my cabinet!

  AFTER: I purchased the needle roller after reading many mixed reviews. Some people swear by its usage while some people find it barbaric and would never even consider using it. I chose to try it as a last resort before undergoing any high cost beauty treatments. I'm in my mid-30's and it seems that when I use beauty products on my face they just sit on top of my skin. I wanted something that was going to help the beauty products penetrate my skin. I've only used the needle roller once and my experience was that while I felt as though I had gotten sunburn, it didn't hurt. It was more irritating than anything. When I used it, I did it before bedtime so that I could let my skin rest a few hours and take in my face product. I do recommend using a face product that is natural and that isn't harsh on the skin. I used an Eminence product which is natural and organic so as to not irritate my skin. I will say that after using the skin roller just one time, my face felt softer and looked much more refreshed than it normally does. I'm pretty sure the roller had something to do with it. So far so good.

  AFTER: This mascara is in an easy to see, green container. The product does not clump as stated from my several days of wearing this. It goes on really well, not too thick or thin. The brush does a good job of getting my lashes evenly coated. The one flaw is that after a few hours of wear, if I accidentally touch my lashes, the black mascara starts to flake off my lashes. I'm not talking about rubbing my eyes or anything fierce, but just touching my lashes -- black flakes. It's not horrendous, mind you, but still annoying as I expect my mascara to stay on even if I touch my eyes a little bit.  But still, I do like that it doesn't clump, looks greats on my eyes, and is in a cute little green container (as opposed to a black one which is hard to find in my makeup bag).

  AFTER: I do not know if it works or not because my hair has not grown but I have not used it on a regular basis but what I hate about this product is the smell, they should add fragrance in it or something. It makes your hair smell like fried chicken grease and it absolutely awful. I may try to pair it with a conditioner or something to alleviate the problem and will update my review after I do but if you are interested in using this product by itself it may not be the best idea unless you like walking around smelling like a deep fryer,which even using the smallest amount will make you smell like that.

  AFTER: Is your hair thinning? Edges breaking off? Want thicker hair? This is the oil for you. One of my fellow natural hair bloggers recommended this product to me and I have not been disappointed. I do not have a problem with thin hair or breakage but I would to ensure that doesn't occur. I started using this product daily to apply to my hairline prior to smoothing it back. Since I've been using it, I've noticed that my hair all over is really thick and really strong. It has a nutty smell to it and a thick consistency. It smooths onto your hair very easily and is absorbed well.

  AFTER: Aging baby boomers, my wife and I don't get out as much as we once did, but we do still go out occasionally. My wife has always used very light makeup, but she still uses mascara to highlight her eyes and long lashes. When she developed a slight tremble in her hands a couple of years ago, she was concerned about applying mascara for fear of injuring her eyes, so I volunteered to apply it. Surprisingly, she accepted my offer. One of her biggest gripes about mascara is its tendency to clump and look messy, so she was glad to try Clump Crusher.The product comes in a sealed bottle with a separate brush that you can see through the packaging. The brush is slightly curved at the applicator end, which has dozens of very fine bristles about 1.5 mm long. The round brush's handle is about 0.9" in diameter, which makes it easy to hold. That's the obvious stuff.In use, we both appreciated how the fine bristles separated and coated her lashes evenly with no noticeable clumping. I applied one coat of the mascara to both her eyes around noon yesterday, then we left the house for about seven hours to deliver Christmas presents and have dinner at a restaurant. When we returned, we both examined her eyes and found no smudging or flaking, even with a few tears shed at one stop. Later that evening, my wife removed the mascara with a washcloth and warm soapy water. It removed fairly easily with no visible traces left.Overall, the Covergirl Clump Crusher Mascara appears to be a fine product that works as advertised. My wife is sold on the product.

It is a well known product.This is a  nourishing lotion which contains Colloidal Oatmeal blended with rich emollients to moisturize skin for a full 24 hours. I think it improves the health of my skin in 1 day with significant improvement in 2 weeks. It helps prevent and protect dry skin, it leaves skin feeling soft, smooth and naturally healthy-looking. It is gentle enough for everyday use, fragrance free, nongreasy, and noncomedogenic.I have been using the for several years and keep it in my bathroom.Recommended. prisrob 06-05-13

  AFTER: I get really dry skin, especially in the wintertime.  I'm sure you're excited and curious which parts of my body experience the dryness, right?  Well let me ease your delights!  Under my ears is the main spot.  In fact that's the main reason I bought skin cream to begin with.  Flakey, crusty skin that peels on my lobes, on both ears.  Skin also peels on the back of my ears.  It's sort of annoying.  Another popular spot is on the sides and back of my neck.  I will wake up and see balls of dry skin on my bed linen that will absolutely *have* to be shaken off.  This Aveeno lotion helps quite a bit.  Applying enough lotion around bedtime will ensure that by morning my skin will be healthy and improved. My lips also get crusty but I have chapstick to take care of that one.  My forehead and the tip of my nose are two other frequent skin-peeling locations.  Aveeno skin lotion will fix whatever's ailing your skin, guaranteed.

  AFTER: Upon opening the box to try this soap (mind you I was skeptikal about using a bar soap on my face), it looked raw and although it was smooth to touch it still didn't look like a regular bar of soap. The smell was invigorating and it captured my attention as soon as I started washing my face. This soap does not lather much so do not expect it to. Too much lather strips skin from moisture whereas this soap infuses your face with moisture and hydration. The process is rather simple to use, wet face/body, wet soap, apply to face and rinse. Your face/body feels soft and smooth to touch. When rinsing the soap off your face/body it does not leave a oily or sticky residue behind.With all the benefits the dead sea has to offer and the fact that there are no additional chemicals, it is a go to product. Although it is pricey for a soap, since it does not lather much it will last long.

  AFTER: I think this is the best mascara, and I've been all over the map with mascaras.  This one has been the best by far.  It keeps your eyelashes coated without clumping, and you can add more to really build volume.

  AFTER: Well, if you say this roller doesn't hurt, you are kidding yourself. It does hurt, a lot too. However, this is when you apply pressure. But, if you keep it within the same area, the pain lessens. I was excited to receive this based on other reviews and my own personal research. I have since used the product about five times. At first, I used it a couple of times every other day, then I started waiting a week in between rolling. Your face does feel like you got a sunburn afterwards. Some people say it goes away within an hour, for me, it takes at least a day. After 24 hours, my skin looks plumped up. Although, it appears to get back to normal after three days (or two). I think it's working, but I can't be 100% sure. My skin seems to look better than it did when I first used it. I'm going to keep working with this. I have tried many other ways to boost collagen, so as long as I follow instructions, I don't see how it can hurt.

  AFTER: This was one of the cheaper NYX mascaras that I wanted to try. I like the other NYX eye products (eyeliners, eye primer, eyeshadow) so i thought I'd give their mascara a try. When I first got this the tube was a lot smaller than what I thought it'd be (not a problem though because I don't blow through mascara like I do other eye makeup. Just thought it's be bigger because if th shape). I also, opened it and looked at the consistancy and it looked very thick so all in all I thought it was gonna be very clumpy and flaky but surprisingly it was not. It actually went on rather smoothly and didn't clump hardy at all. It did a tiny bit but that's because I put about 3 coats on and on the 3rd there was some clumping but not in the first 2. It does build rather well so you can get a more dramatic look. The brush is also pretty neat.

  AFTER: Most ppl use this product to grow back thinning hair or bald patches. I never encountered any of these but I use it anyway to keep my hair strong and thick. No product performs miracles. For the ppl that complained about it, you have to change your whole hair regimen and being balanced in other aspects of your life to see change. Diet, exercise, moisturizing, etc. This product works, but you have to work with it. The smell is a bit nuttier than I would like but it's nothing toxic and you can always mix it or you a fragrant hair cream on top like shea moisture curl milks. I continue to repurchase this and I also get it in lavender.

  AFTER: Even though I disinfected with alcohol, I developed strange bumps under the skin on the back of my hands that became infected. My skin developed bumps that wouldn't go away for 3 weeks. This is very cheap and flimsy and there are much better ones out there. I ended up buying the SheEssentials 1 mm with 1.5 mm changeable head, and it was FANTASTIC! I paid a bit more for it, but it's way better quality and has a lot more needles than this did, 600 needles for the smaller head and 1200 needles for the larger one. I'm not sure how many needles this product has, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's 300. This means less skin will get punctured. I definitely saw much better results with the 600 needles. The fact that it came with two heads made the price comparable to this when you factor that in. The double-wide roller was a huge plus for larger areas as I have a lot that I'm treating and trying to roll stomach or thighs with a tiny roller would take days.Dermarolling has been amazing for me. I've had great results with my other dermaroller for stretchmarks and loose skin- in only a few sessions! It has given me hope that I thought I would never have again, when my body changed so rapidly from rapid, extreme weight gain and loss. It's a huge difference on 20 year old stretch marks that I thought would never go away. On my belly it 'raised' old, indented stretchmarks so they can now be healed and exfoliated.Dermarolling has given me so much hope and a lot more pride in myself and I can't recommend anything more strongly. It's definitely worth trying before other, more invasive and expensive measures. But please do your research first and make sure you are getting the best dermaroller for your money. Don't be afraid to pay just a little more for a product that will give you even better results. And please make sure you really research on how often to do it and what mm is best for your area of treatment. Also, just because I experienced such amazing results in such a short time, don't give up if you don't. From what I've researched, it can take several months of repeated treatments before some people see strong results. It depends on your issue, how long you've had it, and how fast your body is able to heal. Also on whether you are doing this correctly, so again I stress- please do very thorough research even if you just want to jump right in. If you don't give your skin time to fully heal, you'll destroy the results you are trying to achieve. You can actually break down the collagen that is trying to form from your last session if you do it again too soon!I hope this review helps anyone interested in dermarolling. I know how important it can be to have a little hope!

  AFTER: As a fair-skinned lifelong Florida resident, former sun worshiper, and wife of someone who has had melanomas removed several times, I take protecting my skin from the sun fairly seriously.  Not just when I'm going to be out in the sun for extended periods of time, but even during a normal day when I'm only exposed to the sun while walking between buildings and cars.  Those rays really do affect the skin, even in small doses.  Because of that, a couple of years ago I started using a lotion with SPF 15 each and every day.  When I'm going to be out working in the yard or doing some activity that will mean longer exposure I'll use a stronger suntan lotion, but for the usual routine I think  SPF 15 is enough.But just because I want skin protection doesn't mean I want to smell like suntan lotion or feel like I've slathered myself with some kind of greasy goo.  The usual suntan lotions were not something I would be able to make myself use everyday so I went in search of a regular body lotion with SPF protection.  In the past I was using a Eucerin lotion and that wasn't too bad.  But it still had a little bit of a suntan-lotion-type of smell and felt a little weird on my skin so when the bottle started to run low I looked around for another brand to try.  I ordered this Aveeno lotion based on the reviews and ingredients.Well, I have to say the Eucerin is out and the Aveeno is in!  Very, very minimal fragrance that is nothing like suntan lotion, and it feels like normal body lotion on my skin.  The price is great and the 12 oz bottle is a generous size.  I'll probably order the larger size when I run out, I just wanted to start with something smaller to see if I liked it.  Now I just have to get the last bit of Eucerin out of the bottle (don't you hate it when the pump won't suck up the last inch of product in the bottom of the bottle?) and then I can switch to Aveeno full time.Oh - since I started using lotion every day my skin has been much softer, smoother, and generally looks and feels better and healthier.  My dermatologist is impressed. I can't give Aveeno or Eucerin credit for that, though, since I also use another brand's non-SPF lotion at night.  It's just a general statement for those who are lax on using a body lotion daily.  It's easy to forget to take care of the skin, especially the arms and legs, but it really does pay to keep it soft.Anyway, I do recommend the Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion with SPF 15.

  AFTER: I have been using Clinique skincare for years. I use the 3-step, which gets a lot of haters, but it keeps my skin clear which is amazing since I'm prone to breakouts and reactions to stuff. I did notice that the DDML was just not enough moisture for me. I also wanted to start using something more anti-aging since I just turned 40. I was about to plunk down $60 on a Clinique moisturizer when my bestie and I were in Target. She swears by this cream, so in order to save some bucks I bought it. I am SO GLAD that I did! My face is more hydrated, more toned, it's tightened yet more hydrated than its been in ages. My redness and scars are evened out more already in just one week. I have not had any initial reaction or breakouts, if anything my clogged pores are less so. My large pores around my nose are smaller too. I dislike the fragrance, but for this sort of performance, I will put up with it. If they come out with a fragrance free version, I'll be a lifelong user. By the way, I don't care about sticking a finger in the jar, after all, I wash my hands, then my face, so it's clean fingers going in there anyway. I can't imagine that anyone would put dirty fingers in a jar of moisturizer, but ok...

  AFTER: Fast, gentle, light, hair dryer.  No frizz, quick drying results.  The diffuser attachment is rather large and hard to pack into a small travel bag but gives good gentle air.

Don't waste your money on the expensive ones.

  AFTER: This is a great product as all IBD gel polishes are in my personal experience. When it arrived I thought it would be neon pink (the label and the polish look like that) and I wasn't happy about that but once I put it on my nails it was hot pink instead, which was exactly what I was looking for!! It also has a shimmery look to it but you can only notice it in the sunlight (outside). I did 2 coats to achieve that hot pink look, maybe if you do 3 it will look more neon? I don't know... But overall I'm super happy with the color and the purchase. I wanted to upload a pic of my nails with this gel polish but didn't know how to do it on my phone :(

My babe is a pale lilac/lavender color. Eden is a bold (almost) kelly green. Smokey Plum is between a grey and light purple color-the name says it all.  Cosmic Red is packed with red glitter in a red jelly base. Like ruby red slippers. I prefer it layered over a creamy red.  Bing Cherries is a true, fire engine red. This brand has always worn well for me. 2-3 weeks no chipping. (When applied and removed correctly, there will be no damage to the natural nail.)

  AFTER: I had previously been using CoverGirl Lash Exact for my first coat; then Maybelline Falsies for the second coat. It was kind of a pain using two different mascaras, but I liked features of both of them - the plastic brush of Lash Exact and the curve of Falsies. Then I found this one - plastic brush and curve all in one mascara. I also like that it's not a super skinny curved brush, but a little more substantial. I think Clump Crusher is kind of a stupid name, but this is fantastic for maximizing the length of my lashes.

  AFTER: I am very pleased to use this oil. I heard great reviews about castor oil when it comes to natural hair. So I wanted to give it a go, being a "natural products only" type of gal. After deep conditioning and washing with black soap, I went with my usual routine and applied my Kinky Curly leave-in, and instead of purely jojoba, I used jojoba combined with castor oil on soaking wet, freshly washed hair with the leave-in. The result: no sealing in the moisture when my hair is 90% dry! The castor oil is heavy enough to lay down the cuticle layer on the hair shaft down, acting as a sealant. Just like sealing with a butter, except lighter! Lighter means your hair moves more easily. I don't actually need shea butter to seal in my hair now, because this is able to replace it. However I love my shea butter, and I won't give it up without a fight! ;)I now oil my ends with castor oil daily, and my hair seems stronger. I thought I had virtually no breakage then, but NOW its amazing. No breakage at all, hair is shiny, stays moisturized longer, and it helps my skin too. Highly recommend for dry, unruly hair, or dry skin. Tip: More is less with this stuff! You only need 1-2 drops, so it will last a long time.EDIT:1 year later, I am just now purchasing my second  bottle of castor oil. It really lasts. I apply castor oil (2-3 drops per section) to my hair after misting with water mixed with kinky-curly knot today and various oils.(Or after a co-wash)  Prevents breakage, retains the moisture, acts as an emollient for skin and hair, giving hair that luster and skin a fresh glow. I dont use too much because it leaves a greasy feeling. So, dont over-do it. Add essential oils to mask its natural scent, as its a bit funny on its own. I love ylang ylang. Almost forgot to mention, castor oil is wonderful for protecting the skin and hair in winter. My skin and hair have improved after continuous use of castor oil. Will never NOT BE in my cabinet!

  AFTER: I have thick hair, so I need a hairdryer with some serious power and heat.  This model is much better than my last hairdryer.  It only has two heat settings, but that's all I really need.  I sometimes accidentally turn it off because of where the on/off switch is, but it takes 0.5 seconds to turn it back on so who cares.  It doesn't just blow air into my hair, it blows my hair around and gets it dry much faster than other hairdryers. It's light so my arm doesn't get tired.  I haven't had problems with it sucking my hair into the intake vent either.  I've had it for more than a year, and if it dies, I'll get another one.  Highly recommend!

  AFTER: After Avon discontinued my favorite All-in-one cream, I've been trying so many creams.  I've tried Lancme, Estee Lauder, Neutrogena and other Avon creams as well as others.  None of them did a thing for my skin.  In fact, it was starting to look worse, ruddy, dingy.  I was about to give up and just use a cheap all-purpose moisturizer.  Why put chemicals on your face if they aren't working and why pay all that money?As a last ditch effort, I bought some of this Olay Regenerist.  Within 2 days, I noticed my face looking brighter.  The patchy color of my face was evening out and my skin looked clearer.  After a week, I got a few compliments on my complexion!  Under my eyes looks better too, a little firmer (I'm 46).  My face feels so soft too.You don't need a lot.  It smooths on nicely, so one 20.00 bottle should last a while.  It does have a fresh scent that I like, but I noticed they have unscented if you need that.I wish I had tried this first.  I just thought it couldn't possibly work as well as a 75.00 cream.  Well, it works BETTER.

  AFTER: Before purchasing JBCO I researched it for about a year.  WHY OH WHY did it take me so long to purchase?!!!!  This is a must have staple within your head to toe daily beauty regime!  It has a faint peanutty type of smell, but it's nothing that I can't deal with.  When I'm using this on my scalp and hair, whether it's before bed or styling for the day, once I use it, I spray my hair with Palmer's Olive Oil with Vitamin E hair spray because it has a nice clean smell that gives my hair that high gloss sheen all day long.  You will see results with this product so be patient.  Everyone's hair grows at a different pace.  It also depends on how much and how often you apply this product.  I also use it on my eyelashes and around my eyes for my night moisturizer, as well as for blemishes, dry cracked skin, cuts, burns, it is an all purpose beauty secret.  A little goes a long way.  BUY IT, USE IT AND SPREAD THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT IT ~ ENJOY!!!

Strangely, I find the Olay Total Effects creams more hydrating.*Update: From 3 stars to 4 stars. I've been using this for approx. 2 weeks every evening now. Originally, I didn't think this cream was that great. I decided to leave my skin slightly damp before applying. I find this makes the product go on more smoothly. So, now my skin feels more hydrated. :)

The ionic part works well.  My hair is less frizzy and have lot of natural curl so I usually have frizz when I blow dry my hair.  Why I returned it was that it the 2 heat settings were not good for me.  The "warm" was actually hot and the" hot" was way too hot for my fine delicate hair.  Back to the drawing board.

  AFTER: I've tried hoards of mascaras. This wears very well for morning to late afternoon. It will get you through a work day. And it doesn't run or bleed, so that's a great perk. But by evening, it flakes a little bit. Comes off easily with remover; doesn't require a waterproof remover or anything. It's very black, which I like. But the appicator is a little skimpy. I like fullness, so it's not my favorite. If you like separated lashes, this will be a good wand for you. It's also nice and long, which I like. Overall, a pretty good product.

  AFTER: I love the smell and lather of this product. It will show signs of working after a few days and as everyone has a different skin tone and type this might not be for everyone and the results will not be the same. If your using this with another product that could cancel the effect as well.

  AFTER: I use this on my face for acne (which has really worked) as well as replacing my moisturizer and on my hair for softness (which has also worked.) I've been using on my face everyday for two weeks and my hair 1-2 times per week during that span. It looks like hardly any is missing from the bottle--so a little bit goes a LONG way! For the price offered here, you really can't go wrong. I imagine this will last at least 3-4 months.

  AFTER: Bought this to use on hair since I was told to try it in replace of my regular castor oil, and I must say that i was not impressed. I was told a lot of good things about what this could do for my hair but I haven't seen anything differently happen in comparison to me using my other hair oils. It was also more expensive than the regular oil for less product.

  AFTER: Unpacked item, which I felt was well packaged, and sanitary.  It did not have elaborate instructions; basically a small paragraph on the side of the box, but that was fine.  The item did not appear cheap to me like others stated.  I mean&#8230;what do you expect for $10 anyhow?  It did seem smaller than expected, but no big deal.  I washed my face and rolled as directed, 10 rolls in each spot.  I bought this because of previous use with an acupuncture mat (aka Bed of Nails), gently puncturing yourself definitely increases blood flow and endorphin production.  So I can sort of see how this would stimulate collagen growth.  My face turned red, and felt like mild sunburn.  I did my hands and neck too.  I didn&#8217;t really notice anything but irritation at first.  Did my regular routine and went to bed.  This morning, there is no doubt it did something.  The lines around my mouth (I smoked for 17 yrs) are way less apparent, same with the lines on my forehead.  My left hand has tiny red dots, like broken blood vessels?  I may have pushed too hard, but I didn&#8217;t think I was when I was doing it.  My skin feels tight, but like that feeling you get from sunburn.  I don&#8217;t wear heavy makeup, or concealers.  I use a lot of moisturizers, especially Organic Coconut Oil on my fac, hair and body at night (anyone that never has tried coconut oil needs to go get some now!! I used Spectrum Organic Coconut Oil, you can get it at a local grocery store-more info check out my blogs [...] ) during the day I used a tinted SPF moisturizer, it&#8217;s very light.  My skin definitely has a glow today!  May just be irritation but whatever it is, it looks better, so I&#8217;m happy with that!  I think this thing works and honestly didn&#8217;t expect to notice such a difference after first use; I will use it again for sure!  I can see how people with sensitive skin would not like it.  I have a high pain tolerance, I also epilate and wax, so this isn&#8217;t that bad to me.  I&#8217;m hoping it reduces the size of the pores on my cheeks.  And I&#8217;m going to keep using it on my hands.  I&#8217;m glad I found this thing!  I will probably use at most, 1x a week because of how tight my skin feels.  Glad I didnt' go with 2mm yet.

  AFTER: This is the first ionic dryer I have used so don't have a strong comparison. I have been using my $15 dryer from 2000 and finally upgraded my dryer. However, immediately I noticed that it did shortened the time drying my hair and my hair is sleeker and smoother. There are less flyaways. Love it, especially for the price.

  AFTER: Ive been meaning to order this for months. Its the best for regrowing edges. It came on time in a cute bottle. I only use a bit on each temple so it should last at least 2 months. It has a smoky smell that i found kind of strange at first but it ok now and it the thickness of syrup which i kinda like since my hair is thick as well. Its the thickest oil Ive ever used. It moisturises my edges very well especially since its thick. I has new growth already

  AFTER: I needed a hair dryer to use about once or twice a month. I found this at a great price with mostly good reviews so I decided to purchase it. I am transitioning to natural kinky/curly hair and have BSL hair overall. I almost always air dry so i needed something to dry it if I was ever in a hurry. What I was looking for was: at least 1875 Watt dryer, Ionic, Compact, With multiple attachments (at least comb, diffuser and concentrator), Not too loud. This dryer fills all those requirements... except for one thing: no comb-attachment.Since this came with two attachments, I planned to purchase the third one from Revlon. For those unaware, Revlon hair products are licensed to Helen of Troy. I contacted HoT to inquire about which model of comb would fit this dryer, since most comb attachments are expensive and I did not want to waste my money. They were very fast to respond but no one could tell me if there was one available that would fit. After a week, I received an email saying that they do not make a comb attachment that would fit this particular model. They said that this particular dryer has a specific nozzle so no other attachments from them, or other brands would fit it. I was disappointed, since nowhere in the package or description page does it say this. Perhaps I was naive to think that a company would never think not to make other attachments that would fit their best selling economy model, other than the standard out of the box ones. Now I have to think if this dryer was worth it at all. Who wants to buy a separate dryer just for that one extra task?About the product:Pros:lightweight, unbulky overall.Heats up considerably. Warm is an adequate setting for me, but it might be too hot for someone with very fine straight hair.2 attachments, including the concentrator.good value for the price.fast shipping.Medium noiseCons:Cord is too short. Does not rotate easily either.Very cheap plastic, i'm afraid this could melt with heavy prolonged use.Can only be used with the specific attachments that come with it (2), which are not for sale separately (If you contact Helen of Troy they might send you some for free if yours break)Diffuser is a joke. Not long enough for long hair to dry effectively. The fingers are too short and it's not concave so the hot air just stays in the surface. People's heads are nor flat, Revlon!Conclusion:If you use your hair dryer very often, for long periods of time uninterrupted, this might die on you. If you use it very irregularly it's a good balance between the price and use. If you want to use other attachments other than the ones that come with it, you might be out of luck. If you are purchasing this solely for the diffuser, I would stay away from this. Would I purchase this again if it broke down? No, I wouldn't, but it will do for the time being.

  AFTER: This bar soap is very moisturizing and lathers up really nicely. It's perfect for anyone with dry or normal/dry skin, since it hydrates so well. The bar itself is a nice thick size - bigger than most other bar soaps I have used - so it will last quite awhile. I'm usually not a fan of bar soaps since they tend to leave my skin dry, but this soap is as moisturizing and sudsy as a body wash cream. And the best part is that it contains natural ingredients from the earth.At first I was just using the soap on my body in the shower, until I realized I should be using it on my face too, as the directions state. I always get kind of nervous when trying new cleansers on my face and I've never tried a facial bar soap before, but man, this one really impressed me! I have sensitive skin and didn't have any irritation or redness, like I usually do after washing my face. I could feel all the dry skin being washed away, and it looks like it helped clear out my pores as well. This soap rinsed away easily and left my face feeling super clean and soft. I'm so excited to finally have a soap that doesn't leave my face red after using it! It's gentle and moisturizing, which is exactly what I need.

  AFTER: I had ordered this product mainly because i just needed a hair dryer. I was tempted by its price and the brand. I have not used Revlon before, but i took chance just because of its name in the market. People who are not willing to pay a lot for expensive brands like Sedu and Babybliss, can opt for this one as it is cheap and good for daily use. Also, it has two attachments, one being concentrated drying and other, finger diffuser. Additionally, it has cold air and hot air switching control for your comfort. If you are not finicky about the styling of hair and are just concerned with drying, this is the product for you! The delivery was at my door, so what more can i say about it.i would highly recommend this product to everyone.

  AFTER: This color is so pretty. It is full of gold glitter mixed with other colors of glitter to make it stunning. It looks really vibrant when looking at it on the brush, but is actually more see through than I was expecting when on the nail. I put on two coats and it is super sparkly, but more translucent than I prefer but love the color anyways. It is not super bold or flashy, a little more subtle. and is a great everyday color without being too bold

  AFTER: I don't believe there are any miracles in face creams, despite what the marketers would like us to believe.  At 62, I swear I have tried everything in the department stores, including Creme de la Mer, and most of what is in the drugstore.  What it finally came down to was something that was adequately moisturizing but not greasy, and above all, non-irritating.  My favorite daily moisturizer is the Regenerist Serum without fragrance, and I use this one at night because it is heavier and a good moisturizer for the night.  This cream is soothing, non-irritating despite having a bit of fragrance (hardly any).  I'm quite pleased with it, and will buy it again.  Is it as good as a $150 face cream?  I'd say yes, it is.  Olay also makes many of the big department store brands, by the way.  I've bought Lancome, Lauder, Chanel, Clinique, many others, and with many I had skin irritations, couldn't use them and returned them.So this cream meets my criteria for a good face cream and the price is right!  I use the Olay Pro-X cleansing brush at night, followed by this cream and my skin looks great, I don't know of anything better than this cream and you certainly don't need to spend more.  As for the "micro-sculpting" aspect of it...don't believe it.  If you want to improve your skin, use Retin A, good sunscreen, moderate your drinking of alcohol, don't smoke, and take good care of your skin by cleansing it properly and moisturizing when necessary (it gets more necessary as you get older).  I can say for a fact that what you do in your youth determines how your skin looks when you get older.  If you severely damage your skin, there are no miracle creams out there, don't get fooled into believing that.

  AFTER: I give this 5 stars due to the things I consider extremely important in a gel polish.#1 is opacity. This polish took 2 coats to be opaque. That's wonderful!#2 is application. This polish applied wonderfully. Not streaky or too runny. Didn't pool in the cuticle area.#3 is shrink back. This polish has ZERO shrink back. As long as you cap the free edge as usual, there's no shrinking issues.#4 is price. You can't beat the price of IBD Just Gel polishes. They are all very reasonably priced.#5 is lasting power. This polish lasted 2 weeks and 4 days, zero chipping, cracking or peeling. Its looked flawless for the entire manicure.Black lava will now be my go to black gel Polish. Its simply black, no shimmer or frost. Its better than some of the expensive black gels I've tried and lasts way longer and applies better. Also the brush is in my opinion one of the best. Not too big, not too small. Doesn't make a mess of my cuticles :)

  AFTER: I just received this last week and what I can say right away is that this stuff gives moisture without completely weighing the hair down.  I like this much better than regular castor oil which seems a bit more dense.  I am one year into transitioning my hair and I have done the B/C yet.  Brittle and dry hair are very big issues when transitioning..it will really cause breakage if you are not careful.  This stuff when put on the edges of my hair and on the scalp really ads lasting moisture.I don't know about growth at this time but it sure does soften and moisturize so I already know it will be added to my hair regimen.  This alone will prevent breakage. I only gave this 3 stars because I am not sure about it's stimulation for hair growth yet.

I usually use shea butter but because it is summer time I have to put the shea butter up until the winter.  OMG my hair is amazing and lovely.  Black Castrol works it works.  My edges are back and thick now and I have natural dark coloured jet black hair and it has help the shine in the hair. yes it is thick and the smell may not be to your liking but at the end of the day your hair will thank you bc hair needs natural ground earth products. ALSO you must eat healthy as well and exercise your hair needs that too. YOU MUST GET THIS.  You will not be disappointed. UPDATE!!! It is has been a year since I started using Black Castrol Oil and I STILL USE IT!!! What an awesome product!! My hair is extremely longer, thicker and healthier.

Also present are zinc, bromide, sodium, calcium, magnesium and palm oil.  The soap can be used on a daily basis without drying out your moisture-challenged skin.We love it.  It's just what we needed!

  AFTER: Cleansing every morning has become a spa like experience thanks to Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap. I work the Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap into a deep, rich lather and rub in small concentric circles around my face until it is completely covered in the Sea Salt Soap at which point I begin to rinse with cool to warm water until all traces of the soap have vanished.My skin has never felt so clean, and I am being completely honest with you when I tell you that washing my face has never been so pleasurable. I&#8217;ve used liquid face soap religiously for the past 10 years, at least, not a bar soap, but I am loving the results I&#8217;m getting from Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap. I used to only wash once per day, in the morning, because the liquid soap left my face feeling dry and tight, but with Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap, I wash morning and night.There is never a residue with Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap and my face feels refreshingly clean. Adovia&#8217;s bar soap lather is very light whereas the liquid soap I&#8217;d been using felt like there was always a layer left on my skin. I hadn&#8217;t noticed that leftover residue until I switched to Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap and I don&#8217;t think I will go back to a liquid cleanser again.The price point is right up my alley. At $11 a bar, I feel like I am getting this cleanser at a steal. Compared to other bar soaps I&#8217;ve used in the past as a cleanser, I don&#8217;t feel that they lathered as well or left me feeling as fresh and clean as Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap.Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap also has an amazingly clean fresh scent that you can smell before you even take it out of the box. I love awakening my senses to the smell of Adovia&#8217;s Dead Sea Salt Soap in the morning. It makes me feel like I am doing something good for my skin and feeling good in my skin couldn&#8217;t come at a better price.

My skin felt clean and refreshed. I used it in the shower, and it made the bathroom smell so good!I love that this soap has natural ingredients, making it great for your skin.

However it says call poison control if ingested. wtf. The skin is an absorbent organ! Humans can die if their skin comes in contact with poision and absorbs it! So this warning label made me very wary because even if some harmful substance is only present in small amounts in this lotion, there's a chance that there will be build up in my body as I have been using this for years. I'm presently looking for a new body lotion. Any suggestions, fellow reviewers? please leave a comment.

  AFTER: Had a more expensive Babyliss that died after only a few months. That was "ionic" and claimed to speed up drying for long hair (mine is colored as well). It didn't. Thought the whole ionic thing was just hype until I got this dryer. Wow! What a difference it makes in drying my hair. I have also noticed a huge improvement in the shine and smoothness in my hair after using this dryer - all the things I was expecting of the one I had before. I will never go back to the more expensive dryers. They are a waste of money not to mention disappointing. This one is a great value, lightweight and powerful and far exceeded my expectations.

The only negative is the ingredients ( I wish stuff that worked wasn't loaded with chemicals) and the scent. It's very strong.Now, about the age defying properties, I don't think it actually does anything for the skin except moisturize and keep the complexion looking nice.

The shipping was free, and the price was half what it is in the store.  If you have fragile hair, this is for you. If you have thick hair, this is for you. If you have frizzy hair, fine hair, any hair.. well you get the idea!

  AFTER: I've enjoyed mixing my lotions with castor oil to get more use out of them.  I also apply it to my eyelashes at night to stimulate growth and YES it does work!! This oil is great for mixing up moisturizers and also good for cuticles.  The bottle is huge and lasts me quite a while.  Definatly worth it!

  AFTER: Bought this blow dryer some time ago because it definitely is a great package and price. BUT, the way the switches are placed on the handle could NOT be worse. I am constantly turning it off while trying to switch hands or positions. Major pain!!!!!  I will end up donating this just to get rid of it. Very, very bad design.

  AFTER: This works great. The color is good and my lashes are never clumpy or sticky. With a lot of mascaras they run into my eyes and bother me all day. I never have a problem with this one. Great for a night out or for work.

  AFTER: Update: nowhere on this package does it say Night Cream. I didn't know this was a night cream until I saw a magazine ad. I'm disappointed I didn't know because now I have a cupboard full of night stuff and nothing for the day. The only downside to buying Olay products is the lack of directions for use across the board. I think they need to update their packaging to include some directions.I don't have problem skin, and I've always taken good care of it. So, it's not like I've gone from non-existent skin care to trying a product and seeing great results. However, since switching to the Olay brand, I've noticed simply fantastic results. I'm in my 30's, and this product helps reduce the onslaught of tiny wrinkles and age spots that have started to invade my face. I have parched skin, and usually the thickest of hardcore moisturizers don't even do the trick. With this, though it doesn't say it's specifically for dry skin, a small amount does the trick every time (I do use a Regenerist serum underneath, so that could be one reason it works so well). I didn't even notice a heavy fragrance until reading reviews, so that isn't a deterrent for me. I love how soft and smooth my skin feels. I look radiant even sans makeup. I've never been able to say that about my skin since it tends to look dull and lifeless.My only complaint is it doesn't have an SPF. That's a real downer for me since I have extremely fair skin and absolutely have to wear sunscreen when I leave my house. And, with my skin looking refreshed and dewy, I can go without foundation more often. I do not like having to swap it out with another moisturizer that has an SPF on the days I forgo makeup. But then, this is my first time using the Olay brand, so who knows, maybe there is a great moisturizer in this line that has SPF.Overall, even without the SPF, I recommend this. I love the results I've seen with this brand, especially since I wasn't expecting it to perform any better than the other brands I've used.

  AFTER: I imagined that when I opened the bottle liquid would be so thick due to reviewers. Now, I believe those reviewers were new to the ideology of castor oil. I'm a Caribbean (Dominica W.I) woman who grew up using Jamaican black castor oil which is thicker than this. It's a good size for the price. But not as thick. So that's the only reason why I gave it 4 stars. Package is good. Smell is authentic castor oil. No issues other than its not that thick so I can tell I will run out fast if I don't mix it with something else.

I have tried some of the other Adovia Dead Sea Salt  products and have found them to be very nice so I wanted to give this soap a try. My husband also seems to be enjoying it. I like the fact that it is 100% Natural Soap. I have strange allergies and this soap did not cause me any problems!

  AFTER: I read a review (not on Amazon) of this mascara.  Sounded good, so I checked to see if Amazon carries it.  They do, and I decided to try it.  I needed a new mascara, anyway.When I shop for mascara, I check out price, product, performance, and packaging.  I want a product that works well, costs little, and is packaged in a manner suitable for use and preserving the product.  I prefer non-waterproof mascaras, and I like lots of length and volume.  In other words, I'm demanding, and not so easy to please.When I received this, I thought at first I'd received old product because it is SO THICK, it appeared to be dry.  Usually when you open a new mascara, you'll see a bit at the end of the brush you need to wipe off before you start applying it.  No, that wasn't there.  I started putting it on anyway, and SHAZAM!  It does add incredible volume and length, plus, if you twist the wand upward and outward, it adds great curl.  At first I thought, oh, I have too much of this on, but the curl softens a bit.As far as volume goes, you can get it with Cover Girl Lash Blast in the orange tube, or the L'Oreal or Maybelline volumizing mascaras.  They're very good.  But THIS one gets the lower lashes, too, without clumping.This mascara does not flake or smudge.  Even when my eyes are watery from allergies, my mascara stays perfect all day long.  It will clump if you dawdle when you apply it.  Just go at it with confidence.  You can speedily add layers while simultaneously brushing out any clumps.I'm ordering this, or the lengthening version, again.  I haven't tried the lengthening version yet.  This is a great mascara.  It exceeded my expectations.  The only caveat I offer is that because it is so thick, it does take me a little extra time to remove it.  I dab on somePond's Deep Cleanser & Make-Up Remover with Cucumber Extractto soften it before washing my face.

UID: 24328
  BEFORE: <none>
  AFTER: I tend to have a terrible time with mascara. It either smears, clumps, gives me raccoon eyes, stings, or just doesn't do much. But this product lives up to the claims. It gave tremendous volume, and good length- with only one coat! It goes on clump free, doesn't make my eyes itch, and stays put all day. I was out in the wet for hours today, and there was not a trace of raccoon eye; yet it removes easily with soap and water.I have not tried it when wearing foundation, and it's been pretty cold, so I don't know how it'll do with oily skin/foundation, but I'm really hoping it holds up to that because this just became my new favorite mascara. The only complaint I have is the giant container, but I realize it probably has to be large to hold the curved brush.

  AFTER: I was actually looking up body lotions with Sweet Almond Oil and the Aveeno Creamy Moisturizing Oil came up with the best reviews. From there I checked out the Aveeno Moisturizing Body Wash and this also had very excellent reviews. So I purchased both. I am very happy with these products. I used to use Olay Body wash but am now completely in love with these two products. They smell really good and make your skin feel dewy and soft all day. I also love that they contain Sweet Almond Oil, which is very difficult to find in products any longer perhaps because it is an expensive ingredient.

  AFTER: I've always had a problem with mascara clumping. A trick I learned from a makeup artist is to very gently roll the wand in a tissue before applying; it works. This mascara is really good at NOT clumping right out of the bottle. However, it doesn't seem to build & lengthen my lashes as much as my L'Oreal Voluminous mascara. I needed to apply 2 coats to get my lashes thick looking (like the L'Oreal does in one coat) and after doing that, my lashes were mostly uncurled. I've always felt that the CoverGirl mascaras are too wet/thin. They tend to make my eyelashes "uncurl"/straighten out after curling & applying the mascara. This new formula is better than others but still uncurls.The positive part is this mascara did not clump even with 2 coats. But, my nicely curled lashes were no longer very curled. It does wear well; minimal flaking & no smudge after a long day. So I guess if you prefer minimal thickening/lengthening of your eyelashes, this would be a good product for you. I'm not sure I'll keep using it because I prefer a thicker looking lash but it is a good mascara & worth a try if you've had problems with clumping.

  AFTER: I'm finding that more caster oils are becoming very useful. I've already had success with the likes ofHeritage Store Castor Oil, 32 Ounce, and the same thing can be said about this oil. For what its worth, I think this make for a good moisturizer. There doesn't seemed to have any major effects, but my skin does feel better after using this. I think its a great conditioner, so I recommend trying it.

  AFTER: I've used Covergirl products for years.  I'm pleased with this mascara.  It really is a Clump Crusher!  There's nothing worse than clumps of mascara joining 2 or 3 lashes together.  The curved, plastic brush is easy to use and keeps lashes defined.  My eyes look great behind my glasses.  I recommend Covergirl Clump Crusher.It's not just for girls - I haven't been a girl for decades but still like to use natural looking eye makeup.  I think it's almost more important as I've gotten older so I don't look faded or cranky.Well done Covergirl.

  AFTER: This oil has a thickness and heaviness and a unique smell. I like to use it in conjunction with other oils to tone down the uniqueness of it's smell.  I like that consistancy that help other oils add moisture to the skin especially in winter weather and season.  Experiment with it and your favorite oils, you just might make a wonderful surprise.Just an update concerning this product; it works and penetrates areas where there is arthritis, you can feel the tingeling--not burning. The smell is easy to cover up so I want to give this additional info that can be so helpful to arthritis sufferers.

I have thick, long hair and it is a hassle to blow dry and usually the dryer cuts off from over heating at least four times before I'm finished.

  AFTER: I am a lover of Adovia products, so naturally this Dead Sea Salt Soap is no exception!The soap size is perfect for use on the face, or even in the shower. I like to use mine with a loofah and create a nice lather that way. I have sensitive skin, and I had no issues at all with this. I find that most Adovia products are mild enough and do not cause any irritation. As I mentioned above I use this in the shower on my body, but also as a facial soap as well. It leaves my skin feeling very soft, clean, hydrated and smooth. I like the fact that I can use this soap all over, makes for a better value.The smell is a fragrant clean sort of scent. I find that after I have used the soap, I will have a slight scent left lingering on my skin, which is nice. I can use my perfumes over it, and not have my perfume scent be mixed with my soap scent.I have had absolutely no issues with this soap at all, and it is something I give my recommendation on trying!Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.

My edges are back and thick now and I have natural dark coloured jet black hair and it has help the shine in the hair. yes it is thick and the smell may not be to your liking but at the end of the day your hair will thank you bc hair needs natural ground earth products. ALSO you must eat healthy as well and exercise your hair needs that too. YOU MUST GET THIS.  You will not be disappointed. UPDATE!!! It is has been a year since I started using Black Castrol Oil and I STILL USE IT!!! What an awesome product!! My hair is extremely longer, thicker and healthier.

  AFTER: The Adovia Dead Sea Salt soap can be used on your face or body (which is like a 2 for 1 bonus!). I actually used it on my face and body as I&#8217;m pretty dry all over. I typically don&#8217;t use bar soaps because they tend to dry my skin and make it feel really gross and unnatural. This soap is not made of unnatural ingredients, so I knew it wouldn't be a problem. I love Adovia products and this one is no different.I have been using this soap for about a week and have already noticed a difference in my skin. My skin has been so dry that it was almost flaking. I noticed that my skin has been softer, smoother, and more hydrated feeling. I also noticed that the almost flaking appearance has gone. I have also had no reactions to this soap at all, and it certainly has not left my skin feeling tight and gross like most other bar soaps do.This soap initially had a very strong scent after I took it out of the box, however when using it, it&#8217;s not at all strong and has a really nice, light scent that lingers in the bathroom and on your skin after using it. I really like that it leaves a nice light scent vs. a very heavy strong scent. I can&#8217;t really figure out what the scent is but it really is lovely.Adovia&#8217;s soap also lathers up nicely and washes away clean. You don&#8217;t have that feeling afterwards that it&#8217;s still on your skin. You feel nice and clean feeling after rinsing it off.  You really don&#8217;t need to try hard to get it to lather; it does so with little soap. After using a week, the bar still looks about new! I can&#8217;t believe how long this bar of soap is lasting. I&#8217;m also guilty of using this soap to shave with since it does lather up so nicely! It does work very, very well for shaving I have found. I think I might prefer it to shave creams/gels. I also love that it&#8217;s natural! I&#8217;m all about natural!

It has a smoky smell that i found kind of strange at first but it ok now and it the thickness of syrup which i kinda like since my hair is thick as well. Its the thickest oil Ive ever used.

  AFTER: The first time I opened the tube (mind you, it was sealed), the mascara looked like it had already been used - there were little hairs! But upon closer inspection and some research, those &#34;little hairs&#34; are actually fibers incorporated in the formula that make your lashes look longer.It really does do the trick as I got so many compliments on how long my lashes looked. It was easy to apply, didn't clump or smear, and didn't irritate my eyes.

  AFTER: Decided to try it out due to the rave reviews on Reddit's /MakeupAddiction. It does not deserve the hype. I didn't like it at all.It gave me very stiff, clumpy lashes. After a short period of wear it began to flake off and my lash-line became irritated and itchy. This is when I decided it had to go, and I took it off.I've never had an allergic reaction to a mascara so I'm guessing it was due to this product and not an overall sensitivity. I have full lashes, maybe it would be better for somebody with thin lashes, I kinda doubt it though.For a product named clump crusher, and then produced clumps, I mean come on. 1 star. I can't think of a mascara I've liked less.

I am 32 years old and wanted to do some &#34;preventative maintenance&#34; on my skin and I think it shows. Others mentioned to disinfect the product BEFORE and AFTER each use. These are little needles that are puncturing your skin. Infections will happen if you're not smart about disinfecting your face and the roller.

  AFTER: This mascara goes on cleanly and, as the product promises, without clumps.  It removes easily and doesn't smear too much.  It doesn't make short lashes (like mine) long, but at least they're not all clumped up.

  AFTER: I just got this.  I've used it twice, so I can't really give a "review" of the product's performace or efficacy, but I can comment on the "smell" or odor that people complain about.THERE IS NO ODOR!  It's castor oil for pete's sake!  It's smells like castor oil.No big deal.  Once you put it on your scalp or hair, you can't even smell it.And the texture of this oil is not "heavy" either.This brand is "lighter" than the castor oils I've used in the past.  It dissolves quickly.I will add to this review at a later date if and when I get results, if any.Edit:01-14-12Observations:  WHY is this product called "black"?  This castor oil is CLEAR, like all other castor oils.

  AFTER: Its like washing with lotion! It lathers up really nicely but once you rinse you can feel the silkiness on your skin still. I tan and this product helps the tan last a bit longer. I'm not a fan of lotioning up my body, so this helps in keeping me from flaking

  AFTER: I was a bit skeptical when I first used this dryer.  I had been used to loud, powerful dryers and this one isnt that.  Its more quiet and didn't *appear* to have the oomph.  I was proven wrong.  After a few days of adjusting, I realized my long hair was drying just as quickly.  No issues at all, love this product.

  AFTER: I wasn't really expecting this to be as good as it is.  1- 5 I would give it a 5. Very nice brush not clumpy and stays true to color.  I would say it extends and plumps my lashes 60%. I have very short and thin lashes normally and with this mascara you can really see them. Length and width

  AFTER: Recently I was given the opportunity to review an Adovia's product called their Moisturizing Mineral Soap with Dead Sea Salt and Minerals.  Adovia uses minerals from Dead Sea salt - as well as herbs and oils from all over the world.According to their item descrption it says:Item description:- Infused with 100% Pure Dead Sea Salts from the Dead Sea- Dead Sea Salt Contains over 21 Minerals Key to Skin Health and Beauty- Deeply Moisturizing and Hydrating Soap great for Dry and Normal to Dry Skin- Dead Sea Minerals Essential to Skin Function Contained in the Soap Include Magnesium, Potassium, Sodium, Zinc and More.- Great Value and Benefits for A Daily Moisturizing Facial CleanserFor budgetary reasons, I normally use some of the more popular drug store facial cleansers, but I've never really felt that they do a great job of cleaning my skin. I was pleasantly surprised by the mineral soap.  Normally people shy away from bar soaps due to their bad rep.  A lot of soaps contain lye which is totally horrible for your body and causes serious dryness.  Their are a few soaps out there made without lye, but their are far few and between.  Hence why body washes became so popular a few years back.  You were able to put in skin softening ingredients without the harsh chemicals needed and clean and condition the skin at the same time.However this soap was really surprising.  It isn't harsh and contains more natural ingredients than the slew of unreadable chemical names that you'll find on the box of any cleanser at your local drug store. The soap didn't lather as much, but that is given the fact that it lacks all those unnatural ingredients needed in order to get that result.  My skin does feel a bit cleaner than normal and combined with a face exfoliator it's even better.  Also it leaves your skin feeling hydrate since its all natural so you don't get the tight skin feeling that you normal have after using soap on your face or body.  In addition, it's great for washing away make up residue that may have gotten left over by your makeup remover.  I would say this soap is really gentle to use everyday and the fact that it's natural really makes it noteworthy.Adovia so far has surprised me with their all natural products by really giving me wonderful results!

  AFTER: This product smells much better than the JBCO produced by other companies, is thick and rich and easy to use.As for it's ability to grow hair?  Here's my experience with the product.  I had a half dollar sized patch at the top front of my hair that had visibly thinned.  I believe it was due to the tremendous stress I was under at the time, but no matter the reason for it, it was there.  After reading some things said about this product in a Natural Hair forum on FB, I decided to give this a try.  I applied it morning and night with a Q tip to the effected area over the course of a month.  At the end of that time I parted my hair and noticed that the thinning was less than it had been, and called my daughter over to verify, and she saw it too.  I've not been as diligent in using it since then, but I have noticed that the hair has not thinned again, nor has it filled in any more than it had when I was using it.  I stopped using it as often and then not at all because since I wash my hair once a week, the area in which the product was applied took on a very oily feel, so while I may try using it again, I will likely limit the use to once per day.Hope that helps.

Also, there are women who can not use certain products on certain areas of the body.  I had no problem re personal areas.

  AFTER: This mascara separates the lashes well, but it's very stiff going on and hurts my lashes and eyelids when I apply it.

  AFTER: I ordered this product with the hope that it could help with a few white stretch marks on my hips. Note that I have had these marks since I was 13 years old and I am now 29 so the thought of finally minimizing them was worth the try. I did alot of research before I started and followed it religiously giving my skin enough time to heal and benefit from the rolls.I followed the rolling with a natural mixture of shea butter and coconut oil. Though the whole process is a little painful, its bearable and women go through much worse with waxing etc.Unlike others, I did not roll to the point of bleeding. Also ensure that you sanitize and store the product properly between uses.Its not a miracle product but after a few weeks I noticed that the stretch marked skin was smooth and you could no longer feel the indents from the mark itself ( they were still visible).This to me was the most improvement I have ever had in them having tried several creams and scrubs before. My problem with this product is that the needles go dull too quickly. I have ordered two times and both had to be discarded after a few uses. I really wish it was more durable.I will try this type of product again but maybe from a different brand.

I work on my feet and get pedicures about once every couple months and the ladies comment that my feet are really good, not too beat up.  My hands, however....

  AFTER: This hair dryer is the third in a series of attempts to find the right hair dryer for my wife, who has long thick hair.  The first one was a Vidal Sassoon that had ionic technology, but didn't get near hot enough.  She was drying her hair for > 20 minutes.The second attempt was the Revlon RV469 ceramic, which was much quieter and got hotter, but didn't have much air flow.  Also, it is quite heavy.  It was better than the first dryer, but not hair drying nirvana.This dryer (Revlon RV544) has easily cut my wife's drying time in half.  She has very thick & long hair, and the high heat setting makes quick work of it.  It gets hot enough that I actually tone it down to warm for myself (I have short, thick hair) whenever I have to use the dryer.  I think the air flow settings are perfect.  The dryer is also nice and light, and fits in a bathroom drawer easily, unlike some of the bulkier models out there.My wife thinks this is the best dryer she has ever had.  We highly recommend it.

  AFTER: This is a powerful dryer, but it doesn't singe my hair the way most do.  I'm used to a smaller dryer, so the heft took a little getting used to, but my small ones never felt like a salon dryer the way this one does.  My one caveat is if you have a specific storage space, be sure to pay attention to the measurements.  I didn't, but I lucked out.  It stays in a drawer in my vanity that has an electrical outlet built in, and it fits in there with no room to spare.  If it's even lying on a hairpin or its own cord, the drawer won't shut. So, I'm glad I bought it, and I expect we'll have a long and beautiful relationship.

  AFTER: I love the heavy mascara but I am careful to remove excess by 'batting my eyelashes&#34; against a tissue both by looking up and down.  That removes the excess and lets it dry carefully.  Still have to separate those eyelashes sometimes, though.  Still, can't beat the coverage.

  AFTER: Want to revitalize you face and skin tone? Look into products that utilize Dead Sea Salt. It is amazing. This bar of soap feels great. Doesn't give the residue after effect that a lot of infused soaps do so I really appreciate that. Plus, the exfoliation benefits are tremendous and instantly noticeable. I am loving Dead Sea Salt products and will keep trying more options that come available.

Not only does it leave my skin soft and smooth, it smells AMAZING.  I don&#8217;t like super strong smells, but this smells clean and nice without being overpowering like perfume.  Plus, I have super sensitive skin, so some products that I can use on my body, I can&#8217;t use on my face because it will break out.  This doesn&#8217;t  - my face is perfectly fine with this as an in-shower cleanser.  Love it!  I will definitely be purchasing this again!The price is outstanding and it lathers really, really well.  I will definitely be purchasing again in the future!

  AFTER: While I occasionally splurge on Buxom Lash mascara, my tried and true mascaras seem to be the newer series of Cover Girl ones that have come out in the last few years orAlmay One Coat Get Up and Grow Mascara, Black, 0.21-Ounce.  While some folks hate the large brush and tube of these newer ones, I don't mind them, and I love the new bristle brushes that coat without leaving clumps.  I've already had good luck using the regular Lash Blast (the one in the orange tube), but I thought I'd try this new one to see how it works.  I really like it, and it really does leave zero clumps!The curved brush on this also does a nice job of adding a gentle curl to your lashes. The non-waterproof formula stays put, even when my allergies are acting up and my eyes are teary.I bought this in the Very Black color, and it's still natural-looking.Like all Cover Girl mascaras, this also comes off easily, with just some eye makeup remover or face wash and water.  You don't have to tug or pull at your eyes.It's a keeper!

  AFTER: I bought Cover Girl Clump Crusher mascara last week, after seeing a recommendation in "Vogue" magazine.  The model used in their photoshoot had gorgeous eyelashes, and I'm pleased to see that this mascara really delivers!! You'll get your own runway-worthy eyes with the long, thickly emphasized lashes this product delivers.I've tried a number of other mascara products, and this one is my favorite by far.  I've also got sensitive eyes and skin, and need cosmetics that don't cause an allergic reaction.  This is a gentle formula and I've experienced no flaking, so contact lens wearers don't need to worry.It doesn't smear much even if you have to rub your eyes, and washes off easily at the end of the day.I also enjoy Million Lashes by L'Oreal, but Clump Crusher beats it. The price was a little lower than L'oreal here as well. Try it and love it!

I read on WebMd that the active ingredient in this lotion is actually what helps heal dry skin so I gave it a shot.  That was almost 3 years ago.  I use this all over my body, but even more so I use it on my face because that is the only place I have a problem with dry skin, especially in the winter.  Target sells this size bottle for $10.99+ (and on numerous occasions it has been out of stock)but with Amazon's super saver subscription I get it delivered on time every 2 months for a cheaper price.

  AFTER: I am a lover of Adovia products, so naturally this Dead Sea Salt Soap is no exception!The soap size is perfect for use on the face, or even in the shower. I like to use mine with a loofah and create a nice lather that way. I have sensitive skin, and I had no issues at all with this. I find that most Adovia products are mild enough and do not cause any irritation. As I mentioned above I use this in the shower on my body, but also as a facial soap as well. It leaves my skin feeling very soft, clean, hydrated and smooth. I like the fact that I can use this soap all over, makes for a better value.The smell is a fragrant clean sort of scent. I find that after I have used the soap, I will have a slight scent left lingering on my skin, which is nice. I can use my perfumes over it, and not have my perfume scent be mixed with my soap scent.I have had absolutely no issues with this soap at all, and it is something I give my recommendation on trying!Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.

  AFTER: This is 100% castor oil.  SUPER thick and sticky but it leaves your hair feeling so soft and touchable...its amazing.  I add this oil to shea butter for my hair creams and it whips to perfection.  I also used it alone after cowashing and my hair was sooooo soft.  It is VERY thick so be careful.  I noticed a big difference in the softness and strength of my hair when I used this product alone.

  AFTER: I have tried numerous creams over the years...this is my favorite.  Feerls great and moisturizes well, especialy note a reduction in the fine lines around my eyes.  Does not leave a greasy feel which can be a problem under makeup.  Absorbs in nicely.  Seems to have evened skintone and eliminated a few chronic dry patches. Great choice for overall moisturizer/wrinkle reducer.

  AFTER: Recently, I was told by a dermatologist I needed to use a moisturizer and was given some recommendations, of which Aveeno was one. I narrowed it down to EucerinEucerin Skin Calming Daily Moisturizing Creme, 14 Ounce Tubes (Pack of 2)and CetaphilCetaphil Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion, 8.0-Ounce Tubes(Pack of 2)for daily use. This Aveeno didn't make my final cut because it seemed just a bit "heavier" on the face than the other two. But since I had it, I stuck it in my gym bag and began using it after workouts. Now, I love it for that purpose. Maybe after a workout my body appreciates something a tad heavier.I never thought i would be writing about moisturizers but since I created a little research project for myself, I thought I should share my findings.

  AFTER: Quality , great smelling soap.with amazing ingredients and loads of minerals to keep my skin soft. I packed my bar into my suitcase for my recent beach vacation and it was such a great thing to do. Perfect for all of the sand, salt and chlorine that vacations bring. Pretty packaging, a nice light scent. I love this soap and need to keep it stocked in my pantry. My skin feels great. Add it to a giftbasket for the woman you love.

  AFTER: I think this may be one of those items that is brought in from China as not an authentic item.  On it's first use, I went to use the cold shot button and it stuck to that.  I changed all the settings hoping it would get reset, but for the day, it did not.  I turned it on the next day and it was working again.  Pretty poor for a brand new hair dryer.  Also, it gets extremely hot to where it can easily burn your head, even on its lowest setting.  Total piece of garbage.

  AFTER: As soon as I received this oil I automatically smelled it to see if it smelt of burnt ashes, and surprisingly I was pleasantly surprised that it smelled good. I just mixed it with my almond oil and diluted it with some water and generously applied it to my roots and ends and the next day my hair was nice and soft. I haven't seen any growth yet but I'm sure I will.I recommend this to those who are transitioning to natural hair.

  AFTER: It's a good mascara, but I do not see much difference between different brands. Mascara is mascara. This one has a nasty "bulb" of black stuff at the tip every time you take the brush out, but a lot of them do. Other than that it's a regular mascara, works just fine.

  AFTER: I am a mascara junky.  I will try almost any brand, from expensive (Chanel) to quite cheap (Maybelline). I heard about this product on the Today Show and went right out and purchased it. I can't express strongly enough how much I dislike it. My lashes stuck together so much that I spent a ridiculous amount of time using a lash comb trying to clean them up. Guess I'll stick to my favorite (Buxom), not the cheapest, but this product allows me to give my lashes great coverage without clumping.

  AFTER: Ive been meaning to order this for months. Its the best for regrowing edges. It came on time in a cute bottle. I only use a bit on each temple so it should last at least 2 months. It has a smoky smell that i found kind of strange at first but it ok now and it the thickness of syrup which i kinda like since my hair is thick as well. Its the thickest oil Ive ever used. It moisturises my edges very well especially since its thick. I has new growth already

  AFTER: Olay Regenerist Microsculpting Cream does what it is advertised to do.  This is the third or fourth jar that I have had, but this is the first time I've ordered it from Amazon, and Amazon's price is good.I've tried much more expensive facial creams and lotions and they either didn't work as well, or for the money they were no better.  The Microsculpting Cream is a rich cream that doesn't go on heavy, but has just enough moisturization for my combination skin without being too much or leaving my skin too dry.  The best feature of the cream, for me at least, is its sculpting ability, especially around the jawline.  After a couple of weeks of use, I can always see my jawline tighten up enough that it's noticeable.  At 66, that's definitely worth it!I chose to get the scented cream just because I enjoy a little scent to cosmetic products, but it is available in unscented.  It doesn't take a whole lot for one use, so this lasts a good while. Since I have a mild case of rosacea, I put a thin layer of Finacea lotion (from my dermatologist) on first, then the Regenerist Cream.  It's good for the neck, too.Highly recommended.

  AFTER: This was my 1st every castor oil product about a year and a half ago. I first heard about it on a hair care forum and I decided to give this a try. OMG! It is amazing. My hair line was gorgeous and my hair fuller & thicker. After I ran out of my 1st bottle I made the mistake of switching to Jamaican Black Castor Oil because of all the raves both on this site and elsewhere. Biggest mistake I ever made and biggest lesson I ever learned - everything ain't for everybody. All the strides I had made with NOW were undone by Jamaican Black Castor Oil, which caused my hair to shed tremendously. Unfortunately, it took me some time to connect all my crazy shedding to the Jamaican Black Castor Oil resulting in losing about a 1/3 or more of my hair's original thickness. Once I stopped using it, the shedding stopped. I have since re-ordered my tried and true NOW brand castor oil, along with incorporating some ayurvedic products into my regime like nupur henna, indigo, theraneem shampoo (love!) and more recently alma, brahmi, neem powder & shikakai. My hair is getting back on track.

  AFTER: This mascara is in an easy to see, green container. The product does not clump as stated from my several days of wearing this. It goes on really well, not too thick or thin. The brush does a good job of getting my lashes evenly coated. The one flaw is that after a few hours of wear, if I accidentally touch my lashes, the black mascara starts to flake off my lashes. I'm not talking about rubbing my eyes or anything fierce, but just touching my lashes -- black flakes. It's not horrendous, mind you, but still annoying as I expect my mascara to stay on even if I touch my eyes a little bit.  But still, I do like that it doesn't clump, looks greats on my eyes, and is in a cute little green container (as opposed to a black one which is hard to find in my makeup bag).

  AFTER: I have pretty nice skin overall except for the same recurring 'patches' as I call them on my car. Right near my nose but before my cheek. Both sides of my face. If I stay on top of them... they aren't really there. If I dont moisturize or keep them dirt free they get red and peely. Looks awful and it's right on my face.This stuff does the trick. Daily with this and it's pretty much 95% gone. I try to keep this in stock always.

Best decision ever to buy.If you are not one for pain I do not recommend it will hurt the first few times, especially on my hips!

  AFTER: This Dead Sea Salt Soap form Adovia is a good entry way into the world of bar soap.  It&#8217;s made of natural (and easily pronounceable) ingredients:  palm and palm kernel oil, dead sea salts (magnesium, sodium, potassium, zinc), demineralized water, and natural extract fragrance.  I feel pretty good about putting this on my skin and my skin feels pretty good about it too.Compared to shower gel, it&#8217;s not as moisturizing, but for a bar soap, it&#8217;s not too drying.  It leaves me feeling very clean.  It also does a phenomenal job of getting rid of funk.  Seriously.  This is the soap to use after a workout or a long weekend camping.  I think it gets rid of stink better than most shower gels I&#8217;ve used.I am also in love with the fragrance of this soap.  It has a fresh, clean, laundry dried in the sun smell that I wish I could bottle and spray in my car.  Because it smells so good, I wish the smell lasted longer on my skin.  But I&#8217;ll take it making my bathroom smell nice and crisp after I shower.

  AFTER: I bought this Castor Oil strictly for any hair and skin benefits.  I do not have any scars, or stretch marks to test it on, but I can comment on any hair/scalp and skin benefits.My Hair condition:  Dry, course textured, thick, and color treated hair, (frizzy hair in both humid and dry climates) about an inch longer than shoulder length, with a small patch of itchy dry psoriasis in the back of my head.Facial Condition:  Dry skin, and since moving to the Southwest Desert, a very dry and acrid climate ...even drier skin.  I have reached my sixties, so with age; my skin has become challenging dry.Hair ChallengeMy first test object was my hair and scalp.  I decided not to brush my hair for the very first time ever, before shampooing.  I mixed 1/8 tsp. of castor oil in with a handful of my regular shampoo and lathered up.  I did not think that this could possibly be enough, but according to the other reviews that I had read, "a little tiny bit was supposed to go a long, long way."  My hair lathered up nicely, and then I rinsed.  I noticed four things immediately.1) Lose fall-out hairs were minimal - even though I did not brush my hair out first.2) That small patch of psoriasis was soothed - even though I did not use the medicated shampoo.3) No mats or tangles - even though I skipped the conditioner.4) My wet hair felt good, not slimy, not greasy, not oily, just a healthy hair feeling.I skipped my usual leave-in conditioner, and proceeded directly to the blow drier.Results:My hair dried a little faster than usual, and was incredibly soft, soft like a kitten or a puppy's fur.  My hairstyle finish was not quite as smooth or defined as I prefer, it came out a little too fluffy, but with the addition of a few spritzes of argon oil, the results were perfect.  Another bonus for me was that there were very few hairs left on my roll brush, only 4, or 5, which means that there was no hair breakage.  I usually pull an awful lot more hair off my roll brush when I am finished with the blow dry.  The final positive result was when I was out in the sunlight, my hair had a bit of a healthy, clean shine.  This is unusual for my hair because a thick, course textured head of hair does not generally have that characteristic, only my hairdresser can perform this miracle.Facial Challenge:As I have mentioned earlier in this review, I have very dry skin.  I applied a small amount of the castor oil on my face in the evening.  It is thick, and it is greasy, but this is what my dry skin requires because within an hour or so, the castor oil was completely absorbed.  I decided to lightly coat my face once more before bed.  In the morning, my face was a little dry, not sandpaper dry, as I have experienced in the past, but not that soft suppleness that I was hoping to achieve.  However, my skin texture and color was better and a little more even toned!In the other areas of my face that I have used this oil, I have seen some improvement.  My eyebrows are a little thicker, my lashes are luscious, and where I have been applying the oil nightly around the front fringes of my temple, there seems to be some thickening in some areas.  The little peach fuzz hairs around my hairline have not uniformly thickened in all areas, but I have not been using the oil for that long, and I have noticed that different areas respond at different time rates.  However, whatever improvement that been achieved has completely satisfied what little expectations that I have had in this area.I hope that my review has helped those who share my dry skin, facial, and hair issues.

  AFTER: This is a 4.4 ounce white bar of soap and comes in a neatly designed blue and white box.  It smells great.  But, it's a little on the perfumey side.  This is not a product for the men folk, unless he's walking on heals from a recent pedicure and has his head wrapped up in a floral towel.There are over 26 Dead Sea minerals contained in the bar.  Also present are zinc, bromide, sodium, calcium, magnesium and palm oil.  The soap can be used on a daily basis without drying out your moisture-challenged skin.We love it.  It's just what we needed!

  AFTER: If you're looking to replace your lwil maskriti because you a) can't go to Haiti to pick up a jug or b) can't go to Brooklyn/NJ to buy a bottle, then this product will do as a replacement.  It's very expensive, especially considering how little you get (and compared to how much lwil maskriti you could get for the same price), but it works just fine.  I used this for my scalp, hair, and skin whenever NY's awful winter weather threatened to make my hair fall off and dandruff flakes cascade off my scalp. Worked like a charm.I recommend using this as soon as you wash your hair for maximum benefit (I have 4c hair).  I have noticed that the benefits of this oil aren't as great when I used it while my hair was dry. When I used it while my hair was wet, it eliminated the need for other moisturizing products, and I just put a little shea butter on my ends to hold my double strand twists.Some people don't like the smell, but I really like it - this oil is all my mother used on my hair when I was younger.

  AFTER: This has become my HG mascara. I love the original Covergirl Lashblast in the orange tube but wasn't a huge fan of the large wand since I have small eyes and lashes, so I decided to try this one for the wand alone. They don't lie when they say it doesn't clump. I'm one of those people that puts coat upon coat on to bulk up and darken my light, thin lashes and this one doesn't clump no matter how many times I coat (provided I don't let coats dry in between, but that's just common sense that you don't do that). I haven't had any problems with smudging on my eyelids or underneath my eyes despite getting the regular formula. I like that the brush isn't some gimmick-y contraption like alot of the wands being introduced lately. It's a sturdy brush that's slightly curved and fits the curve of the lashline to get all of the lashes easily, even the hard to get inside ones. I'll no doubt keep trying other mascaras because I can't help myself and i'm a sucker for clever marketing, but I will always have a tube of this on-hand in addition to any other ones I try. I hope they don't discontinue it anytime soon. That seems to happen with anything I really love.

  AFTER: Dead Sea Salt soap sounded to me like it would be coarse (like most exfoliating soaps) but it wasn&#8217;t at all!  It has a very clean, fresh scent to it that stays with me throughout the day.  There is no &#8220;perfumey&#8221; smell that is overwhelming like I&#8217;ve found with some soaps.  It leaves my skin feeling soft and looking smooth.  I love this soap!  I have used it on my babies and it has worked well with no issues.  I would definitely recommend this soap to anyone.

I feel fine about this product I just need to buckle down and use it more often.

My friend, brother, sister and I use it. (Not too often) just when we are heading out to a party or something. It's really good, totally worth buying! :)

It might be cute over the top of the Mischievous Mango color though.  IBD as a brand though is great.  Long lasting, goes on smooth, and the bottle design doesn't make a huge mess like the Gelish does.  Who doesn't like being about to buy 2 colors for the price of 1 of the other brands too!?

  AFTER: This is a good product. (Olay's new professional products line is really very good.) It lasted almost all winter (3 months) because it doesn't take much to cover the face. It did give a descent result - but not a dramatic result. If you are looking for a dramatic change in the surface of your skin it would be best to go with a prescription product. (They can only sell up to a certain strength without a prescription.) I don't like Retin A. I don't want too much skin to peel off, and I don't like they dry flaking it can cause. After selling many different skin care lines for many years and experimenting with others I've learned not to try to do too much of a dramatic change to the skin at once and peel a lot of layers off. Better slow than sorry. We only get one face. So, I don't want to peel my skin off eliminating too many layers at a time. It just seems dangerous to me, and I've seen some really frightening results. (I'm not a dermatologist, but when I've seen others try to peel many layers off at once it looks as if they will scar.) I also think micro-dermabrasion hurts, but that is just me. I've only done it one time.

  AFTER: I bought this item on April 18, 2013 and started using it immediately on fine lines on my face and a selected amount of stretch marks on my stomach.  A little over 6 weeks later, I'm writing a review to report my experience.LOVE!I mainly wanted to get rid of the "11"'s between my eyes.  I won't inject poison into my face so this was the next best option.  Many people report that it didn't work for them but I am reporting that it worked for me!  Are they gone?  No, that wouldn't be possible.  Those are muscles that have been trained over more than 3 decades of repeated facial movements.  In my case, I squinted a lot.  But....they DO look A LOT better.  They are not nearly as deep or noticeable.  I am very fair skinned, red hair, freckles so any blemish on my skin is obvious (to me anyway).Another area I tried was a small acne scar.  It is completely gone now.  It used to be a small dent in my face, sort of like a dimple.  There was a white "thing" in it that I would pick at.  It's gone too!The fine lines around my eyes are noticeably gone - seriously, I look like I am 5 years younger in that area. The lines around my mouth (nasolabial folds) are noticeably less pronounced.  This particular device isn't really suited to handle the lines around my lips.I had a brown spot on my cheek, it's completely gone now.  All over, my face looks brighter, smoother and my skin hasn't looked better in years.I have noticed a slight improvement in the test stretch marks, but mostly because I wasn't too diligent with them.My process was:  wash my face with gentle cleanser and rinse with warm water.  I would roll in an asterisk shape (*) on the target area, up and down (or back/forth)about four times each.  I would follow with a good moisturizer - I used basicLubriderm Daily Moisture Lotion SPF 15 Moisturizer with Sunscreen, 13.5  Ouncemost often, but also usedHydroxatone Intensive Anti-Wrinkle Complex,Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum, Fragrance Free, 1.7-Fluid OuncesandAINHOA Whitess Caviar Renewal Serum, 1.05 Fluid Ounce.  Honestly, I think any good moisturizer works fine, whatever works for your skin.  It doesn't need to be expensive.  Pure coconut oil works great too!!Does it hurt?  No, not really.  It feels like you have a light sunburn for about 45 minutes after use.  During use, it didn't feel bad to me - on a scale of 1-10, 1 being no pain and 10 being the worst, I'd say a 2.  No more painful than plucking eyebrows.  I used it about once, maybe twice a week.  I cleaned it by running super hot water on it and splashing some rubbing alcohol on it before putting it away.  I always washed my face immediately before use.  I never had any rashes, breakouts or any other negative response.I didn't tell my husband that I was using what amounts to a rolling pin with needles in it on my face - he thinks I'm kooky enough already.  Besides, I wanted to see if he would notice a difference and he DID.  He asked if I had been drinking more water or using something different on my face because I look YOUNGER.  And no, he wasn't just flattering me, he was being totally honest, I promise.My final thoughts:  This worked for me, inexpensive, was low maintenance, easy to use and no poison injected in my skin.

  AFTER: I bought this out of curiosity without knowing what I am really purchasing .  And boy does this thing hurt when you roll it over your face!!!!  I would use it more often but it hurts too bad and it makes me sneeze continually.  It also punctured the skin on my nose to the point that it was bleeding.  I am sure it makes the product you put afterwards absorb faster because your skin is punctured.

  AFTER: The heat and cool air is wonderful, I like the cold blast button. There's an indicator light for the ions working like they should. It's attractive in color and style, as far as blow dryers are concerned. It comes with a point attachment and a diffuser. It has three temperatures and the cold blast. The air flow is sufficient, and the heat is not too hot so it burns but hot enough it dries quickly. I've noticed a lot less frizz in my curly hair and my best friend borrowed it and she has super fine straight hair and had it blow dry smooth without any static when she borrowed it.If I had but one complaint, and it's really a minor one: the product 'feels' cheap. i worry a little bit that it's not going to be sturdy over the long haul if I drop it or knock it around.Other than that, I like how it looks, it's light enough it's easy to hold, and I like how it works. I'd definitely recommend it, but I also recommend treating it carefully, because it does look like it won't take a beating very well. if you travel a lot of are hard on appliances like this, you might want to find one a bit 'sturdier' feeling.But I think you'll be pleased with how it does your hair and it's worth the price.

  AFTER: I really like it.  It really moisturizes my hair.  I mix it with my other essential oils to thin it out because it is so thick.  The smell wasn't as bad as I thought it would be at all.

  AFTER: I was on a hunt for a peach gel polish. I was disappointed after purchasing the new Gelish Morning Dew color. Morning Dew was straight up Halloween orange. I don't know how they thought it was great for the new 2013 Spring launch. Anyway, this IBD color is great; pretty. I haven't found anything close to this color. Great color as an addition to my collection. IBD is one of my favorite gel brands that doesn't disappoint in consistency and in wear. I'll try to add a pic soon.

  AFTER: Most ppl use this product to grow back thinning hair or bald patches. I never encountered any of these but I use it anyway to keep my hair strong and thick. No product performs miracles. For the ppl that complained about it, you have to change your whole hair regimen and being balanced in other aspects of your life to see change. Diet, exercise, moisturizing, etc. This product works, but you have to work with it. The smell is a bit nuttier than I would like but it's nothing toxic and you can always mix it or you a fragrant hair cream on top like shea moisture curl milks. I continue to repurchase this and I also get it in lavender.

  AFTER: So... we have a lot of different mascaras but you buy the one you believe will help you achieve the looks you want. With this mascara specifically you get a lot of presicion, and coming from me thats a lot to say(always need to rescue my makeup with Q-tips because I simply can't apply the mascara without a mess cuz my hands shake a lot), I couldnt believe how easy was to apply it on my lower eye lashes and no clumps either, cant say is the best one I've ever used but its pretty good.... The bad part about this type of brush is you cannot roll it over into your eyelashes but I guess this one makes it up.

  AFTER: At first it does a great job of building volume without clumping. By mid-morning, though, it starts to flake, and by the end of the work day, I have horrible black smears under my eyes. I've never used a mascara that performed so poorly over time, and I've used dozens of brands and varieties over the years. Avoid.

  AFTER: I have been looking for a better mascara than I usually use (Maybelline Volum' Express Falsies). I gave this one a try and wasn't that impressed. It feels like hardly any mascara actually gets on your eye lashes so it looks very light. It's easy to take off and I haven't noticed any running but I am looking for a much more obvious looking mascara so this didn't quite cut it.

  AFTER: Heavy and moisturizing cream that is good to use at night time.I would not recommend using this before make up, at least for me, it is too heavy to use under make up.Also, the scent is way too strong.

  AFTER: While I was expecting a bright orange, I was somehow shocked by the revelation that this polish is not merely orange, it is traffic cone IN YOUR FACE orange. It's going to make a great polish for the summer - it looks a bit outlandish and whackadoodle in the cold winter months, but it's a great dupe to Tiki Tiki Laranga by Gelish, for half the price!I also bought Turtle Bay, and have loved it as well. It's a gorgeous teal, that leans more toward a blue than a green tone. It's going to be great for summer.I've been satisfied with the IBD polishes I've received so far, and absolutely love the prices. They last as long as gelish (which is usually until I get bored and soak them off!), and have such pretty, vibrant colors! At this time, I've been using them with the Gelish Foundation and Top It Off, and curing under an LED.

  AFTER: I purchased Aveeno because it has a pretty low toxicity rating on the EWG website.  It works really well, rubs in well and does not leave my skin feeling greasy.  It's nice because it doesn't really have a smell, the fragrances are what can make a product more toxic because of the chemicals.  I recommend this to people with sensitive skin, or any other type of skin.

  AFTER: I really feel that this has helped me from getting wrinkles.  I am in my thirties and I have used this product for about three years.  If you like other Olay products (I love the Microgenerist), Olay sometimes has a rebate (a good one) for spending $50 on their products.  The only thing I don't like is that it has no sunscreen.

  AFTER: I was really excited about this mascara after reading all the good reviews, but it didn't turn out to be as good as I was hoping. The biggest problem is that IT WEIGHS DOWN my lashes, which is the most annoying thing for me. I don't have natural curvy eyelashes like some girls do, so I have to curl my lashes and hope that my mascara will hold the curve. That's the most important thing in a mascara I think, the ability to hold up lashes, not to weigh them down. NYX doll eye mascara does give my lashes volume and my lashes look fuller, but I just can't deal with the fact that my lashes are pointing down after applying this mascara. I'm very disappointed, but I do think if you have curvy eyelashes, this can be good for you. It's very black, and it does add volume.

  AFTER: Adovia Moisturizing Mineral soap made my skin feel so soft, and very clean. I really like that Adovia Moisturizing Mineral soap leaves my skin feeling clean without leaving a residue like other soaps I tried before. My skin feels so soft that my husband noticed, and asked me what was I using. I liked it so much that I used the soap on my babies too! Their skin felt so soft, I mean their skin is soft already, but it made their skin feel even softer, and the scent lingered on them for a long time.I recommend Adovia Moisturizing Mineral Soap for any one that has dry, sensitive, or normal skin.Disclosure: I received Adovia Moisturizing Mineral Soap for review purposes. However the opinions expressed are 100% my own based on my experience with the product.

Also, I've always had very sensitive skin - I have to watch what moisturizers and makeup I use or I may break out.  I had no trouble with this cream at all.  I definitely plan to continue using this product and I highly recommend it to others.

  AFTER: I am surprised how much I like this Clump Crusher Mascara.  The brush is does not pick up a ton of mascara so you have to apply a couple of coats to make it stand out, but on the plus side you do NOT get clumps!  I find that this applies cleaner than most other mascaras I have tried and I find that with the price Amazon.com has (subscribe & Save with coupon) it is a very very inexpensive mascara that does a descent job.  I recommend giving it a shot.  It's a cheap risk!

  AFTER: This is another one of my favorite creams from Olay. It is not very thick or oily so it can be used for both day and night use. I am 67 and don't have any wrinkles, but I can't honestly say whether this is due to the use of Olay products for a number of years or heredity. I can say that I like most of the Olay products and will continue to use them.

  AFTER: I used to use Latisse, but it runs about $120.00 per month and, although I did see some improvement, it was not enough to justify the price. Then I discovered this product. After removing all makeup at night, I apply a bit to the lashes and lash line. I swear I see a difference - longer, thicker, and darker lashes. And it does not sting the eyes, or cause the slight skin discoloration that Latisse did.

  AFTER: I was recently asked to try Adovia's Dead Sea Salt Soap in exchange for my unbiased opinion.  I personally don't care for bar soap because they leave that waxy feel on your skin, but I love all of the other Dead Sea products from Adovia so I wanted to give it a try.As soon as I opened the box, it had a fresh light scent that was very pleasing.The later is very rich and washes off completely.There was no residue at all!!!My Skin was so soft and it smelled fresh all day.I also noticed that the bar of soap doesn't get that slimy feel when it gets wet like other bar soaps do.Overall I loved everything about the soap, I noticed some say the price was a bit high, but this bar will outlast a bottle of body wash for sure.  I think it is very comparable in price, considering the quality is amazing.My son has eczema, and I had him try the soap and it was so gentle on his skin.  This is great for all skin types.

  AFTER: I tried this as well as the regular castor oil, I love them both but would probably prefer this one over the other one. This one cost a couple of dollars more but it works better in my opinion. I have natural hair and my edges were thinning from a hairstyle that I had that was too tight, this grew my edges back almost completely in 45 days, I could see some growth after 2 days. I also put this on my eyebrows for fullness and have friends that rub a little on their eyelashes. I had no problems with shedding like I have read in other reviews. This is my 3 bottle that I have ordered. The only slight problem I had was a small amount of leakage when shipped.

  AFTER: I've been obsessed with my DIY gel nail kit that I got for my birthday and have already accumulated five colors (two Sephora by OPI, one Sally Hansen, and two IBD). To be honest, I prefer the formulation of IBD the best. I find that I have to do three coats (as opposed to two coats with the OPI and Sally Hansen). In terms of removal, I'd say they're all pretty much the same...As for the color itself (Sparkling Embers), I'd say it's a pale rosy gold - almost like champagne! Although there's definitely glitter, the color is subtle enough for me to wear to work (and I work in a pretty conservative commercial real estate office). The thin formulation allows you to pick exactly how much color you want on your nails (rather than just glombing it on all at once).When I first purchased this product, the shipping calculation said seven business days, but it was actually delivered exactly a week after I ordered it. As a long time Prime member, I'm used to the (almost) instant gratification of two-day shipping, but this was definitely worth the wait!

  AFTER: Covergirl Clump Crusher Mascara is designed to give you the ideal length of a good mascara without the clumping, and that is exactly what it does, according to my 17 year old daughter.  She wears mascara not for increasing apparent length but for "definition" and she was pleasently surprised at how well this product worked, and  how many compliments she received.  This is a very versatile and satisfying product.

  AFTER: It was time to try a new mascara, because the "lengthening formula"  I'd been using ( L'Oreal Telescopic Lengthening Mascara)  clumped terribly, almost gluing my lashes together. (Uni-lash is not a good look!)I'm so glad I tried Covergirl Clump Crusher Mascara. I LOVE it, because it adds a ton of lush, natural looking volume, has an intense black color, and it DOES NOT CLUMP.It also stays on all day without smudging, and is very easy to remove  ( I use a basic foaming face-wash product which is safe for use around the eyes).I'll purchase this product again, because it is the only mascara I've tried that is truly clump-free.

  AFTER: I love this moisturizer, it hydrates well, it's not too thick and it never breaks me out. The only negative is the ingredients ( I wish stuff that worked wasn't loaded with chemicals) and the scent. It's very strong.Now, about the age defying properties, I don't think it actually does anything for the skin except moisturize and keep the complexion looking nice. I have few wrinkles but the lines on my forehead seem to remain despite using this product for a year consecutively. So, great moisturizer- that's it.

  AFTER: The following review is based on my wife's use of the product:I've been using this product for a couple weeks and love it. It goes on very smoothly and evenly with no clumps at all. My lashes are evenly coated and clearly separated every time. It stays on all day but comes off cleanly with my makeup remover. I was sent brown instead of my usual color black. I was impressed by the way the brown looked. Dark enough for my taste but still clearly brown. My only criticism is minor- the handle is wider than most other mascara's. It makes it feel a bit awkward in my small hand but ultimately I think it helps me apply the mascara better.

UID: 24546

  AFTER: I am a mascara junky.  I will try almost any brand, from expensive (Chanel) to quite cheap (Maybelline). I heard about this product on the Today Show and went right out and purchased it. I can't express strongly enough how much I dislike it. My lashes stuck together so much that I spent a ridiculous amount of time using a lash comb trying to clean them up. Guess I'll stick to my favorite (Buxom), not the cheapest, but this product allows me to give my lashes great coverage without clumping.

  AFTER: I have to mix it with glycerine to give it 'slip'.  When I mix it, I use it on my body---feels too thick and heavy to put on my hair.  I know some 'naturals' love this stuff but, perhaps I have a psychological resistance to just the words 'castor oil'.  And that old smell is still there.  Remember when your grandmother used to make you take it cuz you were plugged up?  Eeeew!Fortunately, no one can make me eat this stuff!  Perhaps if someone would share with me some incredible natural hair or skin recipe I'd incorporate it more into my routine.  But as it currently stands, I'll stick to my glycerine and coconut oil.

  AFTER: After one use on my acne scars they're 75% better. I use it with lavender oil for pain reduction and skin/scar repair. I use it on my stretch marks and they are better after only two uses. However, this is tramendously painful on non fatty tissues. But before too long--as with epilating--the endorphins kick in and the pain seems to magically fade away. I can here the needles sinking into my facial skin &#34;pop pop&#34;. I can see the blood spots after too. I use it at night to make good use of the nocturnal healing process.

  AFTER: Works well! It's creamy and thick, and is fragrance free, but kind of has an oat-ish smell, not surprising since it has "natural colloidal oatmeal" in it. Actually, reminds me a little of breakfast oatmeal in color and consistency. My skin was really dry and itchy, my doctor recommended Aveeno. When I used it, the next day, my skin felt much better. I like it because it doesn't contain fragrances or other non essential chemicals. I highly recommend it.

I barely drop the soap for it fits in my small hands just right, where regular bar soap feels awkward and super slippery.  This wonderful soap smells great and it is perfect for my dry skin.

  AFTER: I have only used this twice, but wow!!! I had a tummy tuck 6 years ago. I still like to wear a bikini, but I have a long brown bumpy scar. (I was allergic to the stiches they used and my scar bubbled up and didn't heal nice and smooth.)I had been trying hydroquine 4% cream the derm. gave my for my pregnancy mask off and on on it, but it didn't really do anything. I read about the 1mm derma roller and thought I'd give it a try. I don't have a lot of feeling on my scar, so I was able to real "go at it" without any nubbing cream. I wasn't overly harsh, but I can see where I pierced the skin. Once everything was rolled, I looked really sunburnt and had a few flecks of blood. THEN I rubbed the hydroquine cream on top. The next day neither my hubby or I could believe it! It was a tad lighter BUT SMOOTH, NOT BUMPY! I was thinking, maybe everything was just puffy so I waited. A week later, my scar is still smooth!I just did the derma roller again this morning on my scar. More to try to get the cream in it to lighten it some more. There's not too much more to smooth out, so that doesn't bother me. I just can't stop rubbing my fingers over the scar!!!I did do my face the first time when I did my scar w/o any nubbing cream. It is do-able. I did find myself beathing very deeply and concentrating, almost as I did with my contractions when in labor. My face felt sunburnt for the night and tight the next morning. I am going to do it again, but my new serum is on the way, so I am waiting for that and I read you shouldn't do it too often because you don't want to destroy the collagen you are trying to build up. So far, I have nothing but good things to say about the derma roller!

  AFTER: My skin feels AMAZING after using this product. I also really like the smell. Obviously, I would prefer if it was a little less pricey, but sometimes I can splurge on this product.

  AFTER: I ordered the exact same product in two different colors. The bottle of pink gel was fine but this one...the brush was SO stiff, I cant even use it. I had to drop a glob onto the nail and smear it around. If it was a traditional polish, I could simply &#34;wash off&#34; the brush from another bottle but I don't think that is possible with gel. I wont be able to use this polish again because of the brush.

  AFTER: I have been looking for a Glitter Polish that was Glitter polish, not just speckles. I HEART ibd, their stuff has never done me wrong, I was very excited for this to arrive. Shipment was fast, packaging was nice. The polish goes on GREAT, the glitter coverage is AWESOME. Super excited to have fun with mix and match with other colors.

  AFTER: When I first heard Salt Soap, I thought it was going to dry out my skin. It made me a little hesitant to try it. When I got it in the mail, I opened the box and the smell was amazing! It wasn't over powering, but just a very clean smell.  I used it in the shower that evening. I used it on my face, elbows and feet. It is a very gentle soap, and lathers up really well. The soap rinsed clean off of my skin, I felt no residue or drying to any of the areas I applied it to. I just felt clean. The smell stayed on my body for awhile, which since I loved the smell was awesome!It is far from your typical bar soap!  My feet feel amazing! I wear flip flops everyday and your feet can get dry and cracked, this soap has helped heal them. My heels are soft and smooth again.I have used several other Adovia products and they have yet to disappoint!

  AFTER: I love this oil. I have very dry skin and hair and this along with a little glycerin in a bottle of filtered water creates the perfect moisturizing mist. I have naturally dry curly hair and this creates that seal unlike any other oil I ever use. Great for eyebrow and eyelash treatments also if they are thin or thinning! Only need a little as castor oil is very thick and sticky. But this bottle has lasted me forever and I highly recommend it.

  AFTER: I have bought ionized dryers before with little success, however this one definitely lives up to its claims. Aside from drying well with less noise than traditional dryers, I have seen a notable difference in how smooth my hair is. I have even used this on dry hair to calm frizz. Highly recommend.

  AFTER: Since I always use both bar soap and a body wash every time I take a bath, I look for products which are gentle and wouldn't make my skin drier.The Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap has a very nice, fresh scent. I like that it leaves my skin smelling nice even after I rinse it off. I also like that it's gentle enough not to make my skin drier although I can't skip the lotion afterwards (and I haven't found any soap or body wash which can make me not apply lotion after I take a bath). The expiration date at the bottom of the box is also nice since I know that what I'm using is still okay to use.

  AFTER: I'm a fan of Cover Girl products because they work well and aren't overly expensive.  This mascara doesn't disappoint - it goes on smoothly with the brush and doesn't clump on my lashes.  I like that it colors and defines my lashes without thickening them too much, since I'm a little too old to pull off a dramatic super-huge-eyelash look.This mascara stays on all day without flaking or ending up smeared under my eyes, and it washes off easily with soap and water or cold cream.My only complaint is the odd shape of the container.  It's small on one end and top heavy so it wants to fall over, and angled at the other end so it can't stand on that end either.  And it's too fat in diameter to fit in the openings of my makeup case.  I do like the bright green color, since that makes it easy to find in a purse.

  AFTER: Definitely one of my favorite colors IBD makes, just make sure you apply all the layers (dehydrate, bonding agent, base coat, color, top coat) and this will last for days. Whats good about IBD is that you can use other products with it and still have great results. And the bottle is twice the size of gellish.

  AFTER: I am 37 and starting to get those fine laugh lines and "crows feet".  I decided to give this a whirl.  While I like the unscented version better, the scented is still nice and not offensive; I have gotten creams in the past which are just too offensive and give me a headache.  My husband had commented on the earlier creams and for this one he hasn't said a word! (Not to mention the earlier ones did not work though I cannot remember, for the life of me, what they were; obviously I was not impressed.)The scented version has a light, non-offensive odor.  The unscented version has no odor (imagine that).  Regardless, they both do reduce fine lines!I was using it for about a week (8 days maybe?) before I saw a difference.  My fine lines were finer and less noticable.  (Probably no one but I noticed them before I started using this but it made me feel better and that is the point, isn't it?)And, when I got them, the exfoliating face-wash was being sold with it for half off.  And that is also a great product.I recommend this for anyone with light crease lines and who wants to keep their skin rejuvenated! I also highly recommend that you use the Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub Face Wash, as aforementioned.  I will also review that!

  AFTER: This mascara is okay. As it claims, it adds volume and a little length without clumping. The biggest drawback, however, is that it starts flaking after a couple of hours, leaving a residue under my lower lashes. I usually use Covergirl's "professional" mascara, and although I don't think it provides quite as much volume as this one does, it doesn't flake or smear, no matter how long I wear it. Every other mascara I've tried does one or the other. This one didn't smear, but flaking was an issue.

  AFTER: This mascara goes on cleanly and, as the product promises, without clumps.  It removes easily and doesn't smear too much.  It doesn't make short lashes (like mine) long, but at least they're not all clumped up.

  AFTER: Heavy and moisturizing cream that is good to use at night time.I would not recommend using this before make up, at least for me, it is too heavy to use under make up.Also, the scent is way too strong.  But, it did improve my skin the next morning when used at night time.Good results for the price but I hope it was more midly scented..

  AFTER: Who would have thought that a bar soap could do so much for my skin? This soap is really awesome. It smells nice, lathers so well (like a body wash), and leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized. I have dry skin, and this soap has been GREAT! I use it for my face and body and just love it! :D

  AFTER: I order this cream to help my sagging skin, I have lost some weight and need a little pick me up here and there in the face area. I am aging gracefully but want my skin to look it's best. I just received my package today, and put some of the product on, will let you know in a week or two how everything is working out with my skin. I am 70 years old and proud of growing to that age and many more, but sometimes we need just a little help. Thank you.

  AFTER: I used this in a homemade hot oil treatment along with Coconut oil, sweet almond and jojoba. There was a noticible difference between not using this in the concoction and using it. When I mixed this with the rest of the oils, I noticed it was definitely thicker and stickier. I left it on overnight under a cap and rinsed it out the next morning. Not only was my hair softer, but the texture changed! Instead of frizzy curls, my curly hair was silky smooth. After these results, I wish I could use this everynight.. I'd never have a bad hair day again. I love this oil and the positive effects it has on my hair.

  AFTER: I know that obviously it's a bunch of needles so it's not exactly the best feeling on your skin. I feel when I do use it, I feel my skin going into repair mode if that makes sense, helping your skin tighten. I use it alongside iodine for sebaceous hyperplasia, the needles along with the iodine help to go deep into the skin to eat up the oil that causes the big bumps.

  BEFORE: It idnt look as nice over pink as the picture showed. Im not sure what other colors to put it over. Would appreciate any suggestions from anyone.Now to be fair the color of pink they showed wasnt in stock so I used a neon pink for underneath. Didnt look good. the polish its self is a nice red though.
