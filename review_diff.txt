  BEFORE: It idnt look as nice over pink as the picture showed. Im not sure what other colors to put it over. Would appreciate any suggestions from anyone.Now to be fair the color of pink they showed wasnt in stock so I used a neon pink for underneath. Didnt look good. the polish its self is a nice red though.

  AFTER: I love the color.  I have used Red Carpet and Gellish in the past.  This is the first IBD polish I have tried.  I like it just as well as the other brands.  I have only used it once.  It seemed to need a little extra curing time with my LED light.

  AFTER: I love this mascara!! It works wonders at making your lashes long and volumous without making them look cakey.  I find that the mascara is long lasting and is fairly resistant to water.  This replaces my Dior masara as my favorite!!

  AFTER: The shipping was standard. It arrived about 5-7 days after I ordered it. I purchased the product to grow out my hair edges. I seen a couple of reviews on youtube about how wonderful it was. My edges did grow back some, but not as fast as everyone claims, and it wasn't really noticeable. I've only used it a month. I will try it for another 2 months to see.

  AFTER: I was pleasantly surprised  that this product actually works to promote hair growth as many reviews have said. I will continue to use it. I took off one star for the smell and the fact that it  is very heavy on my fine hair. I now mix it with other oils and I like it better.

  AFTER: First let me start off by letting you know about some of the key factors of this soap.- Infused with 100% Pure Dead Sea Salts from the Dead Sea- Dead Sea Salt Contains over 21 Minerals Key to Skin Health and Beauty- Deeply Moisturizing and Hydrating Soap great for Dry and Normal to Dry Skin- Dead Sea Minerals Essential to Skin Function Contained in the Soap Include Magnesium, Potassium, Sodium, Zinc and More.- Great Value and Benefits for A Daily Moisturizing Facial CleanserI have recently shared reviews of other products from this particular brand. I really like the fact that when I am using these products I can see a difference in my skin. With this soap my skin really felt clean, smooth and nourished after washing.I feel like Adovia prides themselves on making quality products for women who are looking for quality and results in the beauty products that they purchase. I am also very interested in the fact that they use minerals and salt from the Dead Sea.Adovia Moisturizing Mineral Soap comes in a sleekly designed box weighing 4.4 oz. It is a very decent sized bar of soap that will last most women a long time. Because the product actually works and makes my skin feel amazing I feel it is definitely worth the price ($11) because it lasts so long you only have to splurge on it every now and then.I would recommend this line of products to any woman that wants to keep their dry, or normal to dry skin clean, nourished and refreshed.

  AFTER: This is a beautiful color, it is just like it's describe a smokey plum, use it several time very happy with it.  It applies dark then it starts to lighten a bit.  It seems to last about 1 1/2 week, not like my gelish 2 weeks and then some.  But all in all I am very happy with this polish.

  AFTER: I was on a hunt for a peach gel polish. I was disappointed after purchasing the new Gelish Morning Dew color. Morning Dew was straight up Halloween orange. I don't know how they thought it was great for the new 2013 Spring launch. Anyway, this IBD color is great; pretty. I haven't found anything close to this color. Great color as an addition to my collection. IBD is one of my favorite gel brands that doesn't disappoint in consistency and in wear. I'll try to add a pic soon.

  AFTER: This is a very nice  'royal' purple.  It looks just like the picture in sunlight but is a bit darker indoors.  Im only giving three stars because from the picture I thought this color would be glittery but it  is just barely noticable shimmer.  It went on smoothly and covered in two coats otherwise.

  AFTER: I purchased this from a seller that offers free shipping and the price was something like under $7. Considering that this price is about what I pay at Target or some other similar store, I think it's reasonable. The brush shape is different than any of mine and it works well because it gets those lashes on the inner and outer aspects at the same time you are applying the center. The consistency is dry but this is not a bad thing, it doesn't tend to form big clumps on the brush or your lashes, and you should apply coats in succession as if you are brushing your lashes as this works best. The other thing I love is that it does not give me raccoon eyes thought it washes off completely with soap and water! I have used a lot of mascaras, the worst was Falsies, which was like pure goop. The best "base" mascara is Great Lash because it's very thin and sort of separates lashes for another mascara but alone is not enough for me. So I typically use Maybelline's Soft and something but they are back on the animal testing list. I find that this works close enough and it doesn't have the drawbacks mentioned. I don't have to use my Elf eye make-up pen to remove smeary mascara half-way through work.

  AFTER: I came across this tool accidentally, didnt even know something like this was on the market, and when i saw it i decided to give it a try, because what it does totally makes sense . I have been using it for a few months now , it is a little hard to get used to it in the beginning, because of the tingling sensation , and the needles, but once you get used to it and start to use it properly you will see the results, now i use it about 2-3 times a week, and my skin has a better appearance because of better absorption of the cosmetic product applied, but it has to be used and paired with good quality cosmetics

  AFTER: OK I have always been a product junkie, spending too much on creams and lotions of all sorts. Never thought to use something as simple as an oil. I feel like I have just come across a gold mine! I initially purchased the product for my man once I read about its benefits in reversing baldness. As I researched a little more, I found many more advantages such as longer and thicker lashes and brows, tightening and softening skin, eliminating wrinkles and stretch marks, removing callouses and warts and other fungal infections, treating acne, shinier healthier hair....etc. So far I have only used it for a couple of days, and I am already blown away. The softening effect on my skin is nothing like I have ever experienced. Never again will I spend money on expensive face creams. Granted, the oil is a little on the thick side, so a little goes a long way. But if you put a couple of dabs around the eyes and massage them on your wrinkles before bed and very little before you go out, you will see the effects almost immediately! I also bought almond oil (since now I am believer in the miraculous powers of oil) just to mix it with since it has a much lighter consistency, and also high benefits to the skin.Another amazing effect is on my callouses on the soles of my feet, as I run a lot. Absolutely better than any foot cream I've ever used. I massage it in nightly and wear socks right before bed. Instant gratification! Been using it on my stretch marks too around my butt, and I already see changes!All I can say is stop spending money on name brands and go for the source. You will not be disappointed!

  AFTER: ok, there is limited clumpiness, but I still found myself pulling out my handy dandy lash separating tool, which is fine, i don't mind the extra effort but I did not find any Wow factor with this mascara. Personally I think the LashBlast Volume (orange tube) is much more clump crushing, I NEVER have clumps or any lashes sticking together even after applying layer on top of layer, and it fans it out perfectly enough where I don't even need my separating tool. This one is ok, but when this runs out im sticking with last blast volume.

  AFTER: There is a deep wrinkle between my eyebrows I've used this on and on my neck and I do notice an improvement in the wrinkles when I use this regularly which is about 2-4 times a week. It doesn't hurt just a little prickly feeling, just go slow and roll back and forth 3-4 times then lift and move to the next spot.  However when I use this between my eyebrows at the top of my nose it does make me sneeze, but that could just be me.

  AFTER: I used to have really dry ends although I cut my hair about a 2 months from using this product. I researched the reason and the only reason I could find was that my hair was not very strong and I needed something like a hair reconstructor. I bought this product since I usually like going natural. I missed 1 teaspoon of honey with 1 teaspoon of coconut oil with 1 teaspoon of this castor oil, microwaved it until it all melted together and put that all over my hair. I left that it for about an hour and there is already a visible difference. The ends of my hair are no longer dry. I have used coconut oil with honey before but the affect of 2 together is nothing like the 3 together. Lots of the reviews were talking about it being too thick and unusable the solution to that is warming it up in the microwave for a few seconds.

  AFTER: Review by Tom's wife.Love the smell & texture of this cream. However, I do not feel that it's hydrating enough for my dry skin. Maybe I should use it with the Regenerist serum. Strangely, I find the Olay Total Effects creams more hydrating.*Update: From 3 stars to 4 stars. I've been using this for approx. 2 weeks every evening now. Originally, I didn't think this cream was that great. I decided to leave my skin slightly damp before applying. I find this makes the product go on more smoothly. So, now my skin feels more hydrated. :)

  AFTER: I have been using this for over six months and I can see subtle differences. For point of reference, my fair, normal skin has been described by a recent aesthetician as "remarkably unlined" skin. This comment wasn't even qualified with a "for your age" which is over 40. I've taken really good care of my skin since about age 13. That, combined with the inability to tan, has laid a good foundation. This is to say, I don't have problems that I'm trying to correct, only prevent. I have noticed improvement on my neck, where I am beginning to get some creases, and also with the crows feet from smiling that were starting to form. Since I have no plans to quite smiling it was nice to see those results.As to the pain of it, I would say that you get used to the slight sting and it's worth it for the results. Make sure to roll slowly or you will make it more painful and risk breaking your skin. Slow and steady is the trick. I use it on my neck, too, where the skin is thin and while I wouldn't say it tickles it's also not cringe-worthy pain either.My routine is this: Every evening after my skin is clean I put on a good moisturizer on my face and neck. I spray the roller, which has been thoroughly washed after the previous use, with rubbing alchohol. I run the roller, GENTLY, multiple times in each direction using short strokes beginning at my forehead and working my way down to eyes, cheeks, smile brackets, and finishing at the neck. I finish off with a more emollient night cream. I live in Arizona where it's quite dry so this last step is due to that fact and not a requirement. Other than the addition of the roller I have not altered my skin care regimen. I do not use astringents because I don't need it and find it drying. I certainly would not spray my skin with rubbing alcohol. I have not changed my skin care regimen except to introduce the micro needle roller.After each and every use, be sure to thoroughly clean the roller per the instructions. This really amounts to running it under hot water which I do after use, not before. This is per the instructions included with the roller. I have my water heater set very high so I know the water is scalding hot. I run it under a gentle stream. After letting it air dry a few minutes I spray it a second time with rubbing alcohol before putting it in its holder to dry. I also leave the lid slightly askew to let air in. The times I've put the lid on tight I've noticed condensation and I don't want it to rust.I found good instructions (both for use and for cleaning up afterward) on YouTube to augment those coming with the roller. It is imperative that you don't share the roller. The instructions say this but please don't ignore that.I would recommend this product based on my experience. In fact, I got my mother one.

  AFTER: Let me start by saying that I do not use night creams, and I do not use this product regularly.  I use it as my Winter time  moisturizer when I go out at night.  I don't use it during the day because it doesn't have any SPF.  Therefore, I can't comment on its long term effects.  But I have to say, it does have pretty decent instant effects.  It does plump up my facial lines and wrinkles, and minimizes them better than any other drugstore wrinkle cream I have used so far. (And I have tried several).  I will most likely purchase this again.

  AFTER: I opened the package in the car and my husband exclaimed, "What is it?  It smells like something my Great Aunt Mildred would wear!"  FYI: He never was a fan of how she smelled.  The good thing is, it smells strong, but it doesn't not smell strong on my face (or hands that I use to lather my face).This can be used as a face and body soap.  I have only used it on my face, and will continue to only use it on my face, as after three days of using it, I have already noticed a difference.  My skin is naturally very dry and breaks out with most products.  I stopped using other products several days before using this so that I would know how the Dead Sea Salt worked.I have noticed the biggest difference in my complexion.  I would recommend this to anyone that has redness or an uneven skin tone.

  AFTER: I used this in a homemade hot oil treatment along with Coconut oil, sweet almond and jojoba. There was a noticible difference between not using this in the concoction and using it. When I mixed this with the rest of the oils, I noticed it was definitely thicker and stickier. I left it on overnight under a cap and rinsed it out the next morning. Not only was my hair softer, but the texture changed! Instead of frizzy curls, my curly hair was silky smooth. After these results, I wish I could use this everynight.. I'd never have a bad hair day again. I love this oil and the positive effects it has on my hair.

  AFTER: I apply a few drops of the serum to my "trouble spots (around eyes, mouth - laugh lines, and forehead-in between brows)" every other day and I feel it makes a big difference in smoothing out fine lines. It seems like it helps with collagen boosting too. I feel like I'm just barely starting to discover signs of aging at 31 years old, and it may be my entire skin care routine that's helping. This stuff does sting a bit (especially if I use it after derma-rolling - OUCH!), and it smells like burnt nuts, but it is working for me. I've been using it for 2 1/2 months and I keep the little bottles in the fridge. I'll definitely re-order this when I'm out!

I had to drop a glob onto the nail and smear it around. If it was a traditional polish, I could simply &#34;wash off&#34; the brush from another bottle but I don't think that is possible with gel. I wont be able to use this polish again because of the brush.

  AFTER: Yep, that's what it does - dries hair. It's not horrible (especially for the price), but there's nothing special about it either. Pay no attention to the claim that it makes your hair shinier, because it doesn't. It didn't add volume, either. However, when I purchased this, I didn't expect either of the claims to hold up - I bought it to dry my hair, and it did...I purchased this in 2010, and had to toss it in the middle of 2013 because the cord started sparking when I plugged it in. I like hair dryers that get hot, but not *that* hot... so in the trash it went. That said, lasting 2 1/2 years at the price I paid is okay with me.

  AFTER: I'm very impressed so far. I've been using 4 days now and can already see a chg in my skin! I've got bigger pores and deep wrinkles on my forehead. I have used every nite very lightly on forehead, nose area & around my crows feet.Very gently rolling. It gets red, I put coconut oil mixed with a few other essential oils.,and by morning I can see my pores starting to get smaller.,and my wrinkles on my forehead are less noticeable. I don't use numbing cream.,don't need to. I know my limits, and so far I'm very impressed.  Recommend to anyone that is looking for a do it yourself fix! I love the price & that I'm doing it myself.

  AFTER: As I'm fairly new to Soak Off Gels, I have had lifting and wear on my nail tips. Though IBD Power Bond has False Nails in it's name, it can be used for soak off gels as well.  I have used it a few times now and find it does help with the lifting issue I had.  Just a little on the tips goes a long way and it helps keep the life of my gel manicure. Very happy about this!

  AFTER: I feel as If this product is an upgrade of elf's 3-1 mascara which I dont mind at all, the product doesnt bother my eyes. Even though I cried with this mascara on my face did not look like I was slapped in the face by a black pain brush. Removing the mascara was quite easy and it did give me some volume/length but I still prefer loreal voluminous mascara(cheaper). I still find this mascara as an alternative :)

  AFTER: There's a sucker born every minute, and I am one of them.La Mer?  Yep, I bought that.Chanticaille?  Yep, guilty.Philosophy?  Yep, there's hope in my jar.Skinceuticals?  Yep, that too.Expensive salon facials?  Yep, I did those.The end results of all my expensive facial product experiments?  Nothing earth-shattering.  If I'm being honest, I liked the La Mer, but I like the Olay Regenerist just as much, and it's waaaaay cheaper.  This is a really good moisturizer, and the best I've ever found at this price point.  It won't perform miracles, but then again, what does?I will continue to buy this.  It's my go-to in the winter months when my skin is drier.  I'm done wasting money on expensive gimmick facial creams.

  AFTER: I have sensitive skin, and often times do not wash my face. I was excited to try this product after trying several other products from their line, and am glad I did! I had no reaction when I used it, and it left my skin feeling hydrated! I dont use much when it comes to beauty products, but this line is defiantly worth the buy! its a little more expensive than just a regular bar of soap, but I limit it to my face, and don't share! Its a very smooth soap with an even smoother feeling after use!

  AFTER: I used to have really dry ends although I cut my hair about a 2 months from using this product. I researched the reason and the only reason I could find was that my hair was not very strong and I needed something like a hair reconstructor. I bought this product since I usually like going natural. I missed 1 teaspoon of honey with 1 teaspoon of coconut oil with 1 teaspoon of this castor oil, microwaved it until it all melted together and put that all over my hair. I left that it for about an hour and there is already a visible difference. The ends of my hair are no longer dry. I have used coconut oil with honey before but the affect of 2 together is nothing like the 3 together. Lots of the reviews were talking about it being too thick and unusable the solution to that is warming it up in the microwave for a few seconds.

  AFTER: Bought this because I wanted to replace Too Faced Lash Injection Pinpoint since its become so hard to find and dries out too fast for the price. The mascara itself is great but I don't get the brush (sort of a curvy hourglass shape--why??). This might just be me because I've been using the incredibly shallow bristles of the pinpoint mascara for years and I like to work in my mascara a little thicker at the base of my lashes instead of bothering with eyeliner most days. I find it very difficult to apply this evenly without a few smudges on my eyelids. It CAN be a little spidery.Best aspect: it doesn't smudge or run when my eyes water, when I yawn a billion times a day, when I sweat or when my skin gets oily. It does smush in a gooey way if I cry and rub my eyes, but that's much better than flaking or running. I live in Savannah, Georgia and it has no trouble with the humidity. I've also slept in it a few times without it smudging or running at all, which is amazing.

  AFTER: This mascara is okay. As it claims, it adds volume and a little length without clumping. The biggest drawback, however, is that it starts flaking after a couple of hours, leaving a residue under my lower lashes. I usually use Covergirl's "professional" mascara, and although I don't think it provides quite as much volume as this one does, it doesn't flake or smear, no matter how long I wear it. Every other mascara I've tried does one or the other. This one didn't smear, but flaking was an issue.

  AFTER: I read a review (not on Amazon) of this mascara.  Sounded good, so I checked to see if Amazon carries it.  They do, and I decided to try it.  I needed a new mascara, anyway.When I shop for mascara, I check out price, product, performance, and packaging.  I want a product that works well, costs little, and is packaged in a manner suitable for use and preserving the product.  I prefer non-waterproof mascaras, and I like lots of length and volume.  In other words, I'm demanding, and not so easy to please.When I received this, I thought at first I'd received old product because it is SO THICK, it appeared to be dry.  Usually when you open a new mascara, you'll see a bit at the end of the brush you need to wipe off before you start applying it.  No, that wasn't there.  I started putting it on anyway, and SHAZAM!  It does add incredible volume and length, plus, if you twist the wand upward and outward, it adds great curl.  At first I thought, oh, I have too much of this on, but the curl softens a bit.As far as volume goes, you can get it with Cover Girl Lash Blast in the orange tube, or the L'Oreal or Maybelline volumizing mascaras.  They're very good.  But THIS one gets the lower lashes, too, without clumping.This mascara does not flake or smudge.  Even when my eyes are watery from allergies, my mascara stays perfect all day long.  It will clump if you dawdle when you apply it.  Just go at it with confidence.  You can speedily add layers while simultaneously brushing out any clumps.I'm ordering this, or the lengthening version, again.  I haven't tried the lengthening version yet.  This is a great mascara.  It exceeded my expectations.  The only caveat I offer is that because it is so thick, it does take me a little extra time to remove it.  I dab on somePond's Deep Cleanser & Make-Up Remover with Cucumber Extractto soften it before washing my face.

  AFTER: I have tried both the expensive and drugstore skincare products and convinced that Olay products gives you the same results as the cosmetic counter brands. This is a great moisturizer at a great value! I have very sensitive skin and use this as a night cream. It makes my skin look better and even toned after applying! I paired this with the regenerist cleanser and get superior results.

  AFTER: I've been using it for 3 days and I already see a difference around my laugh line, basically it's gone. To be fair, I had the beginning stages of laugh lines and this combined with my normal skin care work wonderfully. It is important to note that I should have purchased the 0.5mm because the 1.0mm stings. I'm still getting used to the shock of the stinging sensation. Its stops immediately  after you're done passing the area in your face. Also, make sure that your skin care doesn't add on to the inflammation of your face. I used Apple Cider Vinegar as my skin toner and I make sure not to use it the same day as I use my micro needle roller. Please be aware that sunscreen is very important. I am a person of color and I use the sensitive Oil Of Olay sunscreen moisturizer. I have not broken out at all using it for the year and a half that I've used it.Again, this product is a great complimentary with your skin care line just make sure that you don't use products that is alcohol based or inflammatory skin care product the same day. You'll need a soothing product. If you use natural products I'd suggest a little grapeseed oil afterward on your skin.Oh most importantly, wash your face first and I forgot to mention DO NOT ADD PRESSURE as you roll the micro needle roller on your face. Just roll it on your face, for me I roll it twice around in one direction. You may try it differently but do not add pressure the needles are already doing their job.Hope this helps someone with sensitive skin.

  AFTER: Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap is very nice. It has a light floral scent that is strong when it is taken out of the box, but doesn't overwhelm your senses after it is used. The soap creates a rich lather without much effort. It rinses easily and I didn't notice any lingering soap residue. My skin felt clean and smooth. Looking at it in the mirror after a shower it appeared firm and refreshed. This is a soap I can use daily and still feel it provides enough moisture. Overall a great product.I received a free sample in exchange for my honest review.

  AFTER: I am very pleased to use this oil. I heard great reviews about castor oil when it comes to natural hair. So I wanted to give it a go, being a "natural products only" type of gal. After deep conditioning and washing with black soap, I went with my usual routine and applied my Kinky Curly leave-in, and instead of purely jojoba, I used jojoba combined with castor oil on soaking wet, freshly washed hair with the leave-in. The result: no sealing in the moisture when my hair is 90% dry! The castor oil is heavy enough to lay down the cuticle layer on the hair shaft down, acting as a sealant. Just like sealing with a butter, except lighter! Lighter means your hair moves more easily. I don't actually need shea butter to seal in my hair now, because this is able to replace it. However I love my shea butter, and I won't give it up without a fight! ;)I now oil my ends with castor oil daily, and my hair seems stronger. I thought I had virtually no breakage then, but NOW its amazing. No breakage at all, hair is shiny, stays moisturized longer, and it helps my skin too. Highly recommend for dry, unruly hair, or dry skin. Tip: More is less with this stuff! You only need 1-2 drops, so it will last a long time.EDIT:1 year later, I am just now purchasing my second  bottle of castor oil. It really lasts. I apply castor oil (2-3 drops per section) to my hair after misting with water mixed with kinky-curly knot today and various oils.(Or after a co-wash)  Prevents breakage, retains the moisture, acts as an emollient for skin and hair, giving hair that luster and skin a fresh glow. I dont use too much because it leaves a greasy feeling. So, dont over-do it. Add essential oils to mask its natural scent, as its a bit funny on its own. I love ylang ylang. Almost forgot to mention, castor oil is wonderful for protecting the skin and hair in winter. My skin and hair have improved after continuous use of castor oil. Will never NOT BE in my cabinet!

  AFTER: I tried this as well as the regular castor oil, I love them both but would probably prefer this one over the other one. This one cost a couple of dollars more but it works better in my opinion. I have natural hair and my edges were thinning from a hairstyle that I had that was too tight, this grew my edges back almost completely in 45 days, I could see some growth after 2 days. I also put this on my eyebrows for fullness and have friends that rub a little on their eyelashes. I had no problems with shedding like I have read in other reviews. This is my 3 bottle that I have ordered. The only slight problem I had was a small amount of leakage when shipped.

  AFTER: Well, if you say this roller doesn't hurt, you are kidding yourself. It does hurt, a lot too. However, this is when you apply pressure. But, if you keep it within the same area, the pain lessens. I was excited to receive this based on other reviews and my own personal research. I have since used the product about five times. At first, I used it a couple of times every other day, then I started waiting a week in between rolling. Your face does feel like you got a sunburn afterwards. Some people say it goes away within an hour, for me, it takes at least a day. After 24 hours, my skin looks plumped up. Although, it appears to get back to normal after three days (or two). I think it's working, but I can't be 100% sure. My skin seems to look better than it did when I first used it. I'm going to keep working with this. I have tried many other ways to boost collagen, so as long as I follow instructions, I don't see how it can hurt.

  AFTER: I imagined that when I opened the bottle liquid would be so thick due to reviewers. Now, I believe those reviewers were new to the ideology of castor oil. I'm a Caribbean (Dominica W.I) woman who grew up using Jamaican black castor oil which is thicker than this. It's a good size for the price. But not as thick. So that's the only reason why I gave it 4 stars. Package is good. Smell is authentic castor oil. No issues other than its not that thick so I can tell I will run out fast if I don't mix it with something else.

It has tiny, tiny blue glitter that can only really be seen in very bright light, but adds a wonderful glimmer.I used three coats, though I probably would have been fine with two. It lasted for two weeks in almost perfect condition before I wanted to change to a new color. I mixed it with Gelish &#34;Foundation Base&#34; and &#34;Top It Off&#34; with no problems.It goes on very smooth. It was the first color I used for my DIY gel nails and I couldn't believe how perfect it looked and felt. IBD's color options and prices are fantastic. I haven't been disappointed yet.

  AFTER: I have been using Clinique skincare for years. I use the 3-step, which gets a lot of haters, but it keeps my skin clear which is amazing since I'm prone to breakouts and reactions to stuff. I did notice that the DDML was just not enough moisture for me. I also wanted to start using something more anti-aging since I just turned 40. I was about to plunk down $60 on a Clinique moisturizer when my bestie and I were in Target. She swears by this cream, so in order to save some bucks I bought it. I am SO GLAD that I did! My face is more hydrated, more toned, it's tightened yet more hydrated than its been in ages. My redness and scars are evened out more already in just one week. I have not had any initial reaction or breakouts, if anything my clogged pores are less so. My large pores around my nose are smaller too. I dislike the fragrance, but for this sort of performance, I will put up with it. If they come out with a fragrance free version, I'll be a lifelong user. By the way, I don't care about sticking a finger in the jar, after all, I wash my hands, then my face, so it's clean fingers going in there anyway. I can't imagine that anyone would put dirty fingers in a jar of moisturizer, but ok...

  AFTER: I received a low value free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review. I was not required or compelled to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with FTC 16 CFR, Part 255.I like that this Soap contains Dead Sea Salt and Minerals from the Dead Sea located in Israel. Both ingredients known to provide healing benefits to the human body.This soap come in a small box that well represents Adovia's design and standards. The Soap it self is a good size and it should last for some time.It has a nice scent, but it is very strong, and it made my allergies go a bit crazy. So I was not really able to use it on my face, but I have been using it for my body and do like how fresh and soft it leaves my skin.As much as I like Adovia Products, and while I did like the end results of the Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap, I think it's a bit on the high price, and I'm not sure that I would buy it because of my allergies. If on the other hand you enjoy or don't mind strong scents and are looking for a high quality soap that offers many benefits this may just be the soap for you.A fact that many may find appealing is that this soap can be freely used on the body and on a delicate face as well. Leaving the skin clean, refreshing and soft feeling.I wrote a more detailed review at our site, you are welcome to check it out at craftyspices {dot} com

  AFTER: This soap left my face soft. This soap also smelled great. I also liked that after using this soap I could still smell the fragrance. I also liked that it didn't irritate my skin or anything. Great hydrating soap for dry skin.Overall, would  definitely recommend anyone with dry skin give this soap a try.received complimentary all opinions expressed here are my own.

  AFTER: I love this soap, yea I already love dead sea salt & how softening, moisturizing & just great for skin health it is, so adding it into a bar of soap for me makes it perfect. This soap is smooth & is not at all gritty when using it, not harsh & has a mild scent, the scent does not bother me but might bother others. This soap is great to use for general skin health but is also great for skin issues such as eczema, rough dry skin, psoriasis, hives, rashes acne & more. What I tend to hate about even natural soaps is they leave behind a residue especially if they have any kind of salt in them, this soap not only does not leave behind any residue it rinses off very easily & leaves your skin feeling amazing.You have got to love a soap that is natural, healing, soothing & has soap magnesium, potassium, sodium, zinc & more for a total of 21 minerals needed for skin health & body health. Feel the rich lather that makes you feel like you are not using soap at all, then feel how great it makes your skin feel & look & how others are noticing the great results.Thank you to Adovia for making all these great skin care products, I love what I have tried so far,great company with great communication that really cares about the customers & that is important when buying online.

  AFTER: I have tried numerous creams over the years...this is my favorite.  Feerls great and moisturizes well, especialy note a reduction in the fine lines around my eyes.  Does not leave a greasy feel which can be a problem under makeup.  Absorbs in nicely.  Seems to have evened skintone and eliminated a few chronic dry patches. Great choice for overall moisturizer/wrinkle reducer.

  AFTER: This is great for drier skin, it gets you super clean but still moisturizes your skin. I don't get a tight feeling with either of the soaps but this one is exceptionally moisturizing (=. I have grown to love all of the adovia facial products, they don't make me break out and they don't make me produce excess sebum, winning?!

  AFTER: This mascara didn't WOW me at all, it's just okay. It's slightly on the dry side, I prefer a thinner, glossier texture. This comes out thick on the wand, and clumps easily if you don't apply carefully. I will not repurchase.

  AFTER: I was losing my hair every day during the shower, while I comb my hair and so and so. I ordered this oil (delivery was very fast), the same day I received I put an small amount in my finger and give a 3 minutes massage in the scalp and I let it dry on my hair hours before I go to bed because this oil is very STICKY and smell very BAD, and I dIdn't want to leave stains on my pillow.  Same day I put some oil into my hair shampoo  and conditioner bottle.  So next morning I rinse my hair as usual I put shampoo and conditioner and I noticed there is no hair in the drain and nothing came off when I comb my hair.  Nothing else but no hair loss. NO MIRACLES.  Good for me, Not good for other people.  I will continue using this product and I will put my feedback in about 30 days to see if this oil is really working or not.

  AFTER: The results from dermarolling are amazing, but this particular roller is very cheaply made. I used it twice before it stopped rolling.

  AFTER: Over the last few months I began trying various creams to slow down Mother Nature.When I saw a coupon for Olay Regenerist in a local Costco I decided to give it a try. The cream feels pleasant as you put on, and the skin feels nice after the cream is on. It is absorbed quickly. I did not break up in blemishes like with some other creams that I have tried.Unfortunately, it has a pretty strong scent. I really prefer all products I use too be unscented, especially if I have to use them before going to bed where the smell rubs off on the pillow and keeps me awake.However due to the scent I don't feel like using it on regular basis, and will not be buying it again. Olay, please make an unscented version of this scream.Ali Julia review

  AFTER: I used this roller and saw no positive difference in my skin, but the opposite, I now have white heads all over my face. My first time in 29 years, now I have to deal with black heads AND white heads. I would not recommend. I tried everything to get rid of these white heads and they are still everywhere.

  AFTER: I was looking for a new dryer and found this one. It is very light and not very loud.  The diffuser is huge which can be bad if you travel a lot like me, or have limited storage space.  The ionic part works well.  My hair is less frizzy and have lot of natural curl so I usually have frizz when I blow dry my hair.  Why I returned it was that it the 2 heat settings were not good for me.  The "warm" was actually hot and the" hot" was way too hot for my fine delicate hair.  Back to the drawing board.

  AFTER: I love this oil. I have very dry skin and hair and this along with a little glycerin in a bottle of filtered water creates the perfect moisturizing mist. I have naturally dry curly hair and this creates that seal unlike any other oil I ever use. Great for eyebrow and eyelash treatments also if they are thin or thinning! Only need a little as castor oil is very thick and sticky. But this bottle has lasted me forever and I highly recommend it.

  AFTER: I have very light eyelashes and it's hard for me to find the perfect mascara, UNTIL NOW!  THIS IS IT LADIES!  It doesn't extend your lashes, it just makes them look like perfect eyelashes that dolls do!  I look the shape of the applicator and how easy it is to apply.  It goes on SUPER SMOOTH and you can double coat without waiting!  Lasts ALL DAY LONG.  Not waterproof, but doesn't flake or smear.  I have slept in this stuff and woke up with PERFECT LASHES!!!!  Get one for you and one for a gift, you will wish you did!

  AFTER: I like to go into Sephora and look at makeup, so I don't normally buy this brand (as it isn't sold there). Nor do I have an Ulta near me. So I purchased this a few times when I see it other places. I love it! It really does give you Doll eyelashes. They are really pretty! There isn't much to be said for the volume as the consistency of the product is kinda thin. But, you could always layer it. I never have much luck with both volume and length (even from products that claim to do both). I have used Diorshow, Buxom, and Yves Saint Laurent mascara and this is right up there with them IMO. My only complaint is that I do get some flaking from it later in the day sometimes.

  AFTER: Works well! It's creamy and thick, and is fragrance free, but kind of has an oat-ish smell, not surprising since it has "natural colloidal oatmeal" in it. Actually, reminds me a little of breakfast oatmeal in color and consistency. My skin was really dry and itchy, my doctor recommended Aveeno. When I used it, the next day, my skin felt much better. I like it because it doesn't contain fragrances or other non essential chemicals. I highly recommend it.

  AFTER: After one use on my acne scars they're 75% better. I use it with lavender oil for pain reduction and skin/scar repair. I use it on my stretch marks and they are better after only two uses. However, this is tramendously painful on non fatty tissues. But before too long--as with epilating--the endorphins kick in and the pain seems to magically fade away. I can here the needles sinking into my facial skin &#34;pop pop&#34;. I can see the blood spots after too. I use it at night to make good use of the nocturnal healing process.

I 110% recommend this to anyone whose trying to get smoother skin.

  AFTER: I am surprised how much I like this Clump Crusher Mascara.  The brush is does not pick up a ton of mascara so you have to apply a couple of coats to make it stand out, but on the plus side you do NOT get clumps!  I find that this applies cleaner than most other mascaras I have tried and I find that with the price Amazon.com has (subscribe & Save with coupon) it is a very very inexpensive mascara that does a descent job.  I recommend giving it a shot.  It's a cheap risk!

  AFTER: This has become my HG mascara. I love the original Covergirl Lashblast in the orange tube but wasn't a huge fan of the large wand since I have small eyes and lashes, so I decided to try this one for the wand alone. They don't lie when they say it doesn't clump. I'm one of those people that puts coat upon coat on to bulk up and darken my light, thin lashes and this one doesn't clump no matter how many times I coat (provided I don't let coats dry in between, but that's just common sense that you don't do that). I haven't had any problems with smudging on my eyelids or underneath my eyes despite getting the regular formula. I like that the brush isn't some gimmick-y contraption like alot of the wands being introduced lately. It's a sturdy brush that's slightly curved and fits the curve of the lashline to get all of the lashes easily, even the hard to get inside ones. I'll no doubt keep trying other mascaras because I can't help myself and i'm a sucker for clever marketing, but I will always have a tube of this on-hand in addition to any other ones I try. I hope they don't discontinue it anytime soon. That seems to happen with anything I really love.

My skin felt clean and refreshed. I used it in the shower, and it made the bathroom smell so good!I love that this soap has natural ingredients, making it great for your skin.

  AFTER: I liked the base coat better than the top coat I purchased from the same brand. The brush is shorter than a standard nail polish brush which I found helpful and more accurate. You don't need more than a thin layer of a base coat and it was a great price. Similar to the top coat by IBD it says to cure for 30 seconds using an LED lamp. It took almost 3 minutes to cure the base coat using my LED lamp

  AFTER: Great mascara! I definitely like it better than any of the drugstore brands of mascara I have tried, and it's not that much more expensive. It's at a good price on Amazon (the same or cheaper than what I've seen it in the stores). It gives my eye lashes a nice full look, without the clumps. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants something more than the drugstore brands can offer but less that's less expensive than the department store mascaras.

  AFTER: LOVED this one! It's nearly gone since I used it every day for about a month (and more than one time a day while on vacation).This soap definitely did it's job in removing dirt! It gets pretty sudsy when you use a loofah too! I was a little worried that showering multiple times a day (sometimes even 3 times due to activities) that my skin would get super dry. Luckily this soap is true to it's word though and kept my skin hydrated and moisturized.

  AFTER: It doesn't clump...like the name, but it also doesn't give me the length I'm looking for.  I'm not sure why, but several times when using this item, I've ended up poking myself in the eye with it too.  I think it's the shape of the wand.  It's not awful...just not great.

  AFTER: Ordered this roller in december and used on acne scars and large pores on face had an issue with original roller that was sent and contacted customer service and they sent another one out right away. I havent had any other problems with the roller this one is rolling smoothly and evenly. I love how smooth my face is the next day after using this and how small my pores are. My face gets really red after and use vitamin e and vitamin c serum following morning ( since i do this at night). This is working i use like once a week but i might start using every other day for even better faster results. I recommend this product and again great company, great customer service.

I work constantly with paper at my job and also tend to wash my hands more often than most. Both of these activities tends to dry out hands and this lotion has been a real skin saver for me. I no longer have cracked skin with bloody knuckles from the drying paper and soap from washing. Small enough that I can keep one in my desk and one in my purse or backpack.

  AFTER: I have been seeing this recommended on YouTube for hair growth for a pretty long time. I originally bought this about six months but only used it sparingly when I noticed my hair was dry. I never noticed the results everyone raved about so it took a backseat to my Dabur Vatika coconut oil. Recently, I have been doing my own hair (I was natural for 3 years and switched back to relaxers) which included amping up my regimen. I apply this black castor oil to my temples, outer edges, and ends of my hair. I lie to you not, just in the two weeks of me using it REGULARLY (I apply it every night and then wrap my hair) my hair is noticeably growing. My temples are extremely thin, partly hereditary and partly due to tension alopecia, and I have noticed parts that were bald and slick, now have fuzz and are filling out. Like I said, it's only been two weeks; imagine the results for YEARS! If your goal is hair growth I absolutely, positively, definitely recommend this for you.

It is not only unscented - but doesn't have any fragrance at all which is fantastic - it doesnt even smell like lotion so you can then wear perfume without any clash of scents.  Leaves my skin smooth and super soft.  On a 1-10 scale...this lotion gets an 11.

  AFTER: I give this 5 stars due to the things I consider extremely important in a gel polish.#1 is opacity. This polish took 2 coats to be opaque. That's wonderful!#2 is application. This polish applied wonderfully. Not streaky or too runny. Didn't pool in the cuticle area.#3 is shrink back. This polish has ZERO shrink back. As long as you cap the free edge as usual, there's no shrinking issues.#4 is price. You can't beat the price of IBD Just Gel polishes. They are all very reasonably priced.#5 is lasting power. This polish lasted 2 weeks and 4 days, zero chipping, cracking or peeling. Its looked flawless for the entire manicure.Black lava will now be my go to black gel Polish. Its simply black, no shimmer or frost. Its better than some of the expensive black gels I've tried and lasts way longer and applies better. Also the brush is in my opinion one of the best. Not too big, not too small. Doesn't make a mess of my cuticles :)

  AFTER: This oil has a thickness and heaviness and a unique smell. I like to use it in conjunction with other oils to tone down the uniqueness of it's smell.  I like that consistancy that help other oils add moisture to the skin especially in winter weather and season.  Experiment with it and your favorite oils, you just might make a wonderful surprise.Just an update concerning this product; it works and penetrates areas where there is arthritis, you can feel the tingeling--not burning. The smell is easy to cover up so I want to give this additional info that can be so helpful to arthritis sufferers.

  AFTER: After I used the product, I went on Amazon's site to order the mascara for my daughter and some friends.  I was more than pleasantly surprised that if I purchased it through Amazon, the price was ultra reasonable at $6.00+.  I have used all types of mascaras and for the money, this is really worth it.  I have tried it for a few days, and it does NOT clump or smear below or above my eyes.  I cannot tell you how many expensive mascaras I have used only to be told, "you have some black stuff on your face and in your eyebrows! " Since my eyes tear, I expected some runny marks, but there were none.  The mascara separates the lashes but it does not add volume, so don't expect a fuller lash look.I must admit I was skeptical because of the packaging.  It comes in the hard-to-open bubble wrap, or whatever it is called, which takes a scissors and patience to open. It cheapens the product.  The casing is also tinny;  Covergirl did not put the money into the quality of the tube but I like the green color, I will always find it in my purse!  The wand can be used for different strokes to apply or replenish the product.  For the money, Covergirl is providing the consumer with a quality cosmetic.

  AFTER: I was recently asked to try Adovia's Dead Sea Salt Soap in exchange for my unbiased opinion.  I personally don't care for bar soap because they leave that waxy feel on your skin, but I love all of the other Dead Sea products from Adovia so I wanted to give it a try.As soon as I opened the box, it had a fresh light scent that was very pleasing.The later is very rich and washes off completely.There was no residue at all!!!My Skin was so soft and it smelled fresh all day.I also noticed that the bar of soap doesn't get that slimy feel when it gets wet like other bar soaps do.Overall I loved everything about the soap, I noticed some say the price was a bit high, but this bar will outlast a bottle of body wash for sure.  I think it is very comparable in price, considering the quality is amazing.My son has eczema, and I had him try the soap and it was so gentle on his skin.  This is great for all skin types.

  AFTER: As I've reached the age of 50, my lashes have thinned out quite a bit.  NYX Doll Eye Mascara does add volume, but it can get a bit thick and waxy on the second pass of the brush.  If you can successully apply only one coat without drying, it looks great.  It doesn't smudge and wears well.  It is a bit difficult to remove, but I am only using warm soapy water when doing so.

  AFTER: This is a good cream if you have sensitive or combination skin....or dry skin. if it is oily all over...it will be too heavy for you. not for teens or early twenties... its good for more mature skin and you will love how your skin will stay moist for a long period of time.....I use it all over my face even around my eyes and I normally can not do this with just any face product cause it will sting and burn my eyes.....not this one! I am  impressed!!! so if your looking for something that will help firm and minimize wrinkles and not harsh on the skin and easy to find ...this is it!!I gave it a 4 rating because I do not care for the heavy container and the lid...but product inside is really good!

  AFTER: Great polish.  I bought the Sally Hansen kit but didn't want to spend so much money on their polish.  Some people complain that the polish runs when curing.  Even though the description says you don't need the base coat, you STILL need it.  The base coat gets sticky after curing and therefore allows the polish to adhere to the base coat.  I do a lot of gardening and dish washing and bathing my child.  My nails last for 2 weeks.  I have bought 3 other colors and they all work great.  I plan to buy more...maybe next time I will post a pic!

  AFTER: This is a very good hair dryer. It's Ionic/Tourmaline/Ceramic which is supposed to be easy on hair and minimize frizz. My hair is coarse and kinky and after drying it's smooth, frizz & static free. I use it to dry my hair and then use a flat iron, so I haven't used the diffuser and concentrator attachments. The dryer has Hot/warm, low/high settings and a cool shot. In my opinion, it's relatively quiet. It also has a vent on the back that you have to clean out, which is a new feature than what I'm used to. It's a good thing because a strand of my hair got sucked into the back of the last one (what do you even do about that?) The directions are stated very clear and tell you how to take care of your hair dryer. Revlon is a great trusted brand, and for $16 this is fantastic. Highly recommend.

  AFTER: I have a dry skin and a little bit sensitive, but this bottle really surprises me. It can really moisture my sensitive without feeling greasy, and it won&#8217;t leave any stains on the pillow. It just makes me feel so tight, soft and smooth.I also have some lines, but this one just feels like plumping up my skin, now my lines are slighter then before. Besides this moisturizer is in reasonable price, but come with amazing result, highly recommended to others.But just to be fair, I don&#8217;t like the smell, but I would give it a 5 stars.

  AFTER: I have been using Clinique skincare for years. I use the 3-step, which gets a lot of haters, but it keeps my skin clear which is amazing since I'm prone to breakouts and reactions to stuff. I did notice that the DDML was just not enough moisture for me. I also wanted to start using something more anti-aging since I just turned 40. I was about to plunk down $60 on a Clinique moisturizer when my bestie and I were in Target. She swears by this cream, so in order to save some bucks I bought it. I am SO GLAD that I did! My face is more hydrated, more toned, it's tightened yet more hydrated than its been in ages. My redness and scars are evened out more already in just one week. I have not had any initial reaction or breakouts, if anything my clogged pores are less so. My large pores around my nose are smaller too. I dislike the fragrance, but for this sort of performance, I will put up with it. If they come out with a fragrance free version, I'll be a lifelong user. By the way, I don't care about sticking a finger in the jar, after all, I wash my hands, then my face, so it's clean fingers going in there anyway. I can't imagine that anyone would put dirty fingers in a jar of moisturizer, but ok...

  AFTER: I use this on my face for acne (which has really worked) as well as replacing my moisturizer and on my hair for softness (which has also worked.) I've been using on my face everyday for two weeks and my hair 1-2 times per week during that span. It looks like hardly any is missing from the bottle--so a little bit goes a LONG way! For the price offered here, you really can't go wrong. I imagine this will last at least 3-4 months.

  AFTER: Pros:-It was a relief for itching from Psoriasis.  Now that my psoriasis is gone, I still carry a small compact bottle with this lotion just for occasional itch or mosquito bites.  For me, it works better than anti-itch or anti-puritic lotions just for a rash or itch.  As for as I can tell, perhaps my skin likes the oatmeal so I can't guarantee this for everyone.  I've also had a liking to Sauve oatmeal lotion, it smells a bit better and is very subtle like that of a baby smell/shampoo.-Oatmeal;-Odorless (could be a good/bad thing for those who prefer either way);Cons:  May be a little heavy bc the lotion is fairly thick.Neutral Comment: Shelf life is pretty good, but I wish it was a little longer.

  AFTER: I think this may be one of those items that is brought in from China as not an authentic item.  On it's first use, I went to use the cold shot button and it stuck to that.  I changed all the settings hoping it would get reset, but for the day, it did not.  I turned it on the next day and it was working again.  Pretty poor for a brand new hair dryer.  Also, it gets extremely hot to where it can easily burn your head, even on its lowest setting.  Total piece of garbage.

  AFTER: Had a more expensive Babyliss that died after only a few months. That was "ionic" and claimed to speed up drying for long hair (mine is colored as well). It didn't. Thought the whole ionic thing was just hype until I got this dryer. Wow! What a difference it makes in drying my hair. I have also noticed a huge improvement in the shine and smoothness in my hair after using this dryer - all the things I was expecting of the one I had before. I will never go back to the more expensive dryers. They are a waste of money not to mention disappointing. This one is a great value, lightweight and powerful and far exceeded my expectations.

Problem with Olay is they have just too many different creams, lotions and potions and a lot of them don't have SPF in it, you're not sure whether you should use it as night, day or inbetween treatment just confusing!

I looked horrible!  My entire face was flaky; forehead, chin, eyebrow areas.  I looked like a monster.  I read on WebMd that the active ingredient in this lotion is actually what helps heal dry skin so I gave it a shot.  That was almost 3 years ago.  I use this all over my body, but even more so I use it on my face because that is the only place I have a problem with dry skin, especially in the winter.  Target sells this size bottle for $10.99+ (and on numerous occasions it has been out of stock)but with Amazon's super saver subscription I get it delivered on time every 2 months for a cheaper price.

  AFTER: The first time I tried the soap I was very surprised by it. When you open the box the bar comes in (even before) you get that wonderful soapy smell, one that brings back good memories for me. It's a fresh clean smell and I like that. Using it I was very happy with how well it lathered up and rinsed off. I didn't feel like I had that soap residue still on my skin. But I was still a little leery. I was sure my skin was going to feel dry and rough when I got done.Boy was I wrong!!After washing my face (and then I used it on my whole body) I felt great. My skin was not just clean, but it felt moisturized like I had used a moisturizing body wash. It was clean, fresh, smelled great and soft! My mind has been completely changed about using soap. Time and time again it has worked very well and feels great using.I really believe it is because of all the minerals from the Dead Sea that are in it as well as the palm oil it is made with. The combination makes the Dead Sea Salt Moisturizing Soap something that will gently clean and keep your skin feeling and looking great. I love this soap and think you will too!I received a sample of the product for review. All opinions expressed though are my own!!

I recommend Covergirl Clump Crusher.It's not just for girls - I haven't been a girl for decades but still like to use natural looking eye makeup.  I think it's almost more important as I've gotten older so I don't look faded or cranky.Well done Covergirl.

  AFTER: When I first heard Salt Soap, I thought it was going to dry out my skin. It made me a little hesitant to try it. When I got it in the mail, I opened the box and the smell was amazing! It wasn't over powering, but just a very clean smell.  I used it in the shower that evening. I used it on my face, elbows and feet. It is a very gentle soap, and lathers up really well. The soap rinsed clean off of my skin, I felt no residue or drying to any of the areas I applied it to. I just felt clean. The smell stayed on my body for awhile, which since I loved the smell was awesome!It is far from your typical bar soap!  My feet feel amazing! I wear flip flops everyday and your feet can get dry and cracked, this soap has helped heal them.

  AFTER: Yet another superb product from Adovia!  I have now tried 2 products from Adovia containing the dead sea salt minerals and I have not been disappointed in either one.  I have been using this bar of soap for 4 days now and my skin is so soft and I feel so much more clean when I get out of the shower now.  I live in a very old house that has TERRIBLE water with rust and even the water softener does not help.  Since I started using the Adovia products I received my hair and skin has been so much better!  Using this soap has actually even helped reduce my acne.This soap smells so clean and fresh; comes in a regular size bar and is a very silky smooth white color.  The moment I opened the box from Amazon I could smell it and it was like heaven :)  I love body products that are not heavily perfumed but just smell wonderfully fresh.  You can most definitely smell the ocean in Adovia products, and of course with all of the minerals from the Dead Sea Salts it is always good for your skin.This specific product retails for $11 on Amazon and although it may seem expensive for a bar of soap, the benefits FAR outweigh the costs if you appreciate the healthiness that comes along with using the product :)  Just check out the gorgeous photos of the sea salts that make the products!  Imagine being able to swim in that water every day and the health benefits it would bring!  Then just think of this soap and if you try it you will be hooked!***I received a complimentary product in exchange for an honest and open review***

But by evening, it flakes a little bit. Comes off easily with remover; doesn't require a waterproof remover or anything. It's very black, which I like. But the appicator is a little skimpy. I like fullness, so it's not my favorite. If you like separated lashes, this will be a good wand for you. It's also nice and long, which I like. Overall, a pretty good product.

But there are times when the stars and romance meet in perfect harmony and I just love on something so much I just have to go tell it from the roof tops. Adovia has been that perfect beauty find for me this year. I have had the pleasure of trying several of their products and here is the latest.I recently tried the Adovia Moisturizing Mineral Soap with Dead Sea Salt and Minerals. A soap infused with amazing 100% Pure Dead Sea Salts from the Dead Sea. These salts contains over 21 minerals to deeply hydrate, cleanse and balance your skin. It throughrally cleanses your skin from grim, makeup, sebum and yet never stripping your skin from the vital nutrients and oils it needs. Leaving your skin hydrated, moisturized and feeling healthy. It is truly a perfect moisturizing cleaner for all skin types. Gentle enough for the sensitive of skins and yet balanced for the oiliest of skins.Oh, and did I tell you the smell is beautiful. Its a soft, and clean fragrance. Perfect to start off and end your day with. Truly a favorite.I know your thinking.... its a bar. No rethink that and give it a try. You will be impressed. It will not dry your skin as a traditional bar would. This is a moisturizing bar and it is made to cleanse and hydrate. All you have left is a soft, cleansed, and hydrated face. The bar thing is actually more of a benefit for this product. We are talking take it to the gym, after a day at the beach, on vacation, poolside, and even add it to the guest room this Summer. Since it fits all skin types it will fit all the needs as well.Definitely worth trying. Satisfaction is guaranteed. You have nothing to lose.

  AFTER: I cannot say it enough; I love Adovia&#8217;s products. Yes, there has been one that disappointed, but that was just my opinion. Adovia&#8217;s Moisturizing Mineral Soap with Dead Sea salt is next to the top with their shampoo product.The soap bar is about the same size as a standard bar of bath soap you would find in a store. It has a natural fragrance to it, so it is not overbearing. I started using it to clean my face and within days some of the smaller blackheads just below the surface of the skin started to disappear.On those days when I am especially in need of a deep clean due to exercise or whatever, I will wash my entire body with this mineral soap. Every time I will come out feeling fresh and renewed.This soap moisturizes the skin although you would almost swear that it strips you of every drop of moist skin as you come out of the shower feeling &#8220;squeaky clean.&#34; If you want to experience a fresh and clean feeling, then this is the soap to use.

  AFTER: I am very pleased to use this oil. I heard great reviews about castor oil when it comes to natural hair. So I wanted to give it a go, being a "natural products only" type of gal. After deep conditioning and washing with black soap, I went with my usual routine and applied my Kinky Curly leave-in, and instead of purely jojoba, I used jojoba combined with castor oil on soaking wet, freshly washed hair with the leave-in. The result: no sealing in the moisture when my hair is 90% dry! The castor oil is heavy enough to lay down the cuticle layer on the hair shaft down, acting as a sealant. Just like sealing with a butter, except lighter! Lighter means your hair moves more easily. I don't actually need shea butter to seal in my hair now, because this is able to replace it. However I love my shea butter, and I won't give it up without a fight! ;)I now oil my ends with castor oil daily, and my hair seems stronger. I thought I had virtually no breakage then, but NOW its amazing. No breakage at all, hair is shiny, stays moisturized longer, and it helps my skin too. Highly recommend for dry, unruly hair, or dry skin. Tip: More is less with this stuff! You only need 1-2 drops, so it will last a long time.EDIT:1 year later, I am just now purchasing my second  bottle of castor oil. It really lasts. I apply castor oil (2-3 drops per section) to my hair after misting with water mixed with kinky-curly knot today and various oils.(Or after a co-wash)  Prevents breakage, retains the moisture, acts as an emollient for skin and hair, giving hair that luster and skin a fresh glow. I dont use too much because it leaves a greasy feeling. So, dont over-do it. Add essential oils to mask its natural scent, as its a bit funny on its own. I love ylang ylang. Almost forgot to mention, castor oil is wonderful for protecting the skin and hair in winter. My skin and hair have improved after continuous use of castor oil. Will never NOT BE in my cabinet!

  AFTER: Dead Sea Salt has all sorts of minerals, but I was skeptical whether it would really make any difference in a soap. I have only used the soap a couple times so I can't comment on long term skin effects, but I can say the following things:1. The soap is super moisturizing. My skin was so soft after showering.2. It smells really nice (and neutral - my husband can use it without complaining...)3. The bar is solid. Other moisturizing bars disintegrate. This bar is holding up well in the shower.A few of the minerals in the soap are magnesium and potassium - both necessary for healthy skin and muscles. We soak in epsom salts (magnesium) for health so if the body can absorb any of these from the soap, it's probably a good thing.

I LOVE the price of this brand, and it wears and goes on just as perfect as all the expensive brands.  I have NO problems with peeling or chipping....maybe that is because I put the product on right.

  AFTER: I bought this Castor Oil strictly for any hair and skin benefits.  I do not have any scars, or stretch marks to test it on, but I can comment on any hair/scalp and skin benefits.My Hair condition:  Dry, course textured, thick, and color treated hair, (frizzy hair in both humid and dry climates) about an inch longer than shoulder length, with a small patch of itchy dry psoriasis in the back of my head.Facial Condition:  Dry skin, and since moving to the Southwest Desert, a very dry and acrid climate ...even drier skin.  I have reached my sixties, so with age; my skin has become challenging dry.Hair ChallengeMy first test object was my hair and scalp.  I decided not to brush my hair for the very first time ever, before shampooing.  I mixed 1/8 tsp. of castor oil in with a handful of my regular shampoo and lathered up.  I did not think that this could possibly be enough, but according to the other reviews that I had read, "a little tiny bit was supposed to go a long, long way."  My hair lathered up nicely, and then I rinsed.  I noticed four things immediately.1) Lose fall-out hairs were minimal - even though I did not brush my hair out first.2) That small patch of psoriasis was soothed - even though I did not use the medicated shampoo.3) No mats or tangles - even though I skipped the conditioner.4) My wet hair felt good, not slimy, not greasy, not oily, just a healthy hair feeling.I skipped my usual leave-in conditioner, and proceeded directly to the blow drier.Results:My hair dried a little faster than usual, and was incredibly soft, soft like a kitten or a puppy's fur.  My hairstyle finish was not quite as smooth or defined as I prefer, it came out a little too fluffy, but with the addition of a few spritzes of argon oil, the results were perfect.  Another bonus for me was that there were very few hairs left on my roll brush, only 4, or 5, which means that there was no hair breakage.  I usually pull an awful lot more hair off my roll brush when I am finished with the blow dry.  The final positive result was when I was out in the sunlight, my hair had a bit of a healthy, clean shine.  This is unusual for my hair because a thick, course textured head of hair does not generally have that characteristic, only my hairdresser can perform this miracle.Facial Challenge:As I have mentioned earlier in this review, I have very dry skin.  I applied a small amount of the castor oil on my face in the evening.  It is thick, and it is greasy, but this is what my dry skin requires because within an hour or so, the castor oil was completely absorbed.  I decided to lightly coat my face once more before bed.  In the morning, my face was a little dry, not sandpaper dry, as I have experienced in the past, but not that soft suppleness that I was hoping to achieve.  However, my skin texture and color was better and a little more even toned!In the other areas of my face that I have used this oil, I have seen some improvement.  My eyebrows are a little thicker, my lashes are luscious, and where I have been applying the oil nightly around the front fringes of my temple, there seems to be some thickening in some areas.  The little peach fuzz hairs around my hairline have not uniformly thickened in all areas, but I have not been using the oil for that long, and I have noticed that different areas respond at different time rates.  However, whatever improvement that been achieved has completely satisfied what little expectations that I have had in this area.I hope that my review has helped those who share my dry skin, facial, and hair issues.

  AFTER: I read some great reviews for the Aveeno body wash and body lotion so I decided to try both of them. I use the Aveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Body Wash with Natural Oatmeal when I take my shower. It is like a cleanser that leaves my skin soft without the feeling of a film or an oil. After the shower, I follow up with this lotion.This lotion makes me feel moisturized. It blends into the skin quickly and easily and you can tell when the product has blended into your skin--you don't have to go on rubbing for ages. It doesn't really have much of a smell although sometimes I will get a whiff and it has kind of an odd scent but by the time you rub it in there really isn't a smell that I am aware of. This is great because if you wear perfume you don't have to worry about fragrances clashing. If you are like me and avoid perfumes, this is great because perfumey lotions make my nose itch and then I start sneezing.This lotion is not like any other lotion I have tried. It does not make me feel greasy like some lotions. The consistency does not feel watery so that while I am putting it on it feels like slightly thickened water and when I am done putting it on I know have to put on two more layers of lotion to get a decent layer of moisture on my skin. Unlike other lotions, my skin does not dry out and look dried out a few hours after putting it on. Unlike other lotions, this one is not overbearingly thick, requiring extra muscles to spread the lotion and rub it in.Basically, when you are done it feels like your skin, like you aren't wearing anything, like the way your skin is meant to feel rather than feeling like your skin is covered with layers of a moisturizing product.

  AFTER: The most I had ever spent on a mascara was about $6 and never ended up being happy with my lashes. I've tried all sorts of brands that promise volume, curl, length ect, but I guess I was never to surprised with my outcome considering the price. Despite that, I could never see spending $20 or more on a tube of mascara that would only last me maybe 6 months, and worst yet, what If I spent the money and still ended up dissapointed. I bought the NYX Doll Eye Mascara on a whim, but it turned out to be the best mascara choice I've ever made.I always start out curling my lashes with a revlon metal lash curler. Usually my lashes don't hold a curl, once I apply mascara there back to their usual straight selves after drying. With the NYX Doll Eye, my lashes held a perfect curl all day. My lashes also looked ALOT longer and I have pretty long eyelashes to begin with so the result was very dramatic.The first time I used this, I only applied one coat and was very happy with the results, minimal clumping but the formula is thick enough to coat each lash nicely, perfect dark black color, shiny and noticable. Since I only wear eye makeup I want my eyes to stand out and mascara is my favorite for this.The second and third time I experimented with more layers. If your going to put on multiple coats I would recommend not waiting in between coats for it to dry. If you do this the result is clumps and messy looking lashes. After curling, I applied a few coats ( the brush holds alot of the mascara on it so unless you wipe of the brush before applying you may not need more on the brush for 3 or 4 coats ) angling the brush to fit in with my lashes which adds volume and oomph because of the way it is shaped. I used to prefer the spoon brush ( for extra curl ), but this style brush gets every lash just right and it is fatter at the ends where your lashes are the shortest and sparse and really plumps them up. The result of 4 coats were beautiful "baby doll" lashes which in my opinion looked even better than falsies ( which to me look funny and fake ).If your struggling to decide whether to try this or not, you really should. For the price of only $9 you will not be dissapointed.

  AFTER: This thing is really the BEST mascara I've used.  The lashes look thicker and longer after use. The mascara adds a lot of volume and length to your lashes.The mascara doesn't smudge. If you get it on your upper eyelid, its very easy to remove;use a wet cotton swab and rub it off. It's also a very nice black. Although the little box doesn't look the same as the one shown in the picture. New design maybe? It doesn't make clumps and it's very smooth. I recommend this mascara. :)

If I stay on top of them... they aren't really there. If I dont moisturize or keep them dirt free they get red and peely. Looks awful and it's right on my face.This stuff does the trick. Daily with this and it's pretty much 95% gone. I try to keep this in stock always.

Bel Essence All-Natural Anti-Wrinkle Treatment is the one I tried after this and I'm still using it.

  AFTER: I have tried a lot of skin care products lately and I am very skeptical about any new ones because I use most of them once and never open again. Most of them make me break out, leave me to dry or oily, or simply don't work. I gave this one a try after seeing all of the positive reviews. My skin is sensitive to fragrances and I did not have a problem with this one. I have found this is light enough to use in the morning before makeup and at night after cleansing. It really has improved the texture and smoothness of my skin. It also has minimized my combination skin "freakouts". I tend to get dry and oily at the same time on different areas of my face and this really helps balance it. It doesn't cake up on your skin or make it feel greasy and heavy. This will remain in my beauty regimen for a long time to come. To anyone who is on the fence about trying it, just try it once and you will love it too!

  AFTER: Got it in the mail yesterday and put it to work last night. Reviewers who said it was painful were not joking. I have a high pain tolerance but man, that thing HURTS. I was really fighting back those tears! I also had to take mini-breaks.I tried not to add any pressure but then the wheel wouldn't spin and the needles ended up scratching my face. Imagine rubbing a cactus on your face. OUCH!! So I put just enough pressure to get the roller going and it kept squeaking big time. Did not sound good. I wished the roller was better lubricated so I wouldn't have to use ANY pressure. Then it wouldn't have been so bad. Maybe that's why some people are saying it didn't hurt?My face got red and warm,just like a sun-burn. I was kind of scared at first because I read (afterwards) that it can cause melasma and hyperpigmentation to darken. I was hoping to LIGHTEN melasma/hyperpigmentation, some very fine lines and very few acne scars. Next time I 'll go a lot easier on the pigmented areas and focus more on the lines and scars. Hopefully I can stir up enough courage to do this again in a couple of weeks.Woke up this morning and my face felt soft but dry and warm. It was still red and felt like a sun-burn. Put on all natural moisturizing/repair serums and sunscreen after my morning shower. Up close my face still looked painful but from a distance I had a really nice "sun-kissed glow." It was quite pretty. Like I was wearing a really pretty blush.Well that's all I can say about this roller for now. Hopefully once my face heels fully, I'll see and feel a little more improvement.

  AFTER: I bought Cover Girl Clump Crusher mascara last week, after seeing a recommendation in "Vogue" magazine.  The model used in their photoshoot had gorgeous eyelashes, and I'm pleased to see that this mascara really delivers!! You'll get your own runway-worthy eyes with the long, thickly emphasized lashes this product delivers.I've tried a number of other mascara products, and this one is my favorite by far.  I've also got sensitive eyes and skin, and need cosmetics that don't cause an allergic reaction.  This is a gentle formula and I've experienced no flaking, so contact lens wearers don't need to worry.It doesn't smear much even if you have to rub your eyes, and washes off easily at the end of the day.I also enjoy Million Lashes by L'Oreal, but Clump Crusher beats it. The price was a little lower than L'oreal here as well. Try it and love it!

  AFTER: This is my second favorite mascara after max factor 2000.  As the product says, you get no clumps, and I like the fact that it comes in brown shades.  While this lasts on your eyes longer than max factor, it's not as build-able, so you get less dramatic eyelashes.  If you are just looking for a little emphasis and no-fuss mascara (for work for example), but don't need super big lashes, this would be a good product for you.

  AFTER: Want long, voluminous, non-clumpy lashes? Look no further. This mascara is amazing! I have long lashes already. I wanted something that emphasizes that more and gives a lot of volume. This does exactly that. And the lashes are nicely separated and not clumped together making it look like I have 5 really thick eyelashes. The only thing I dislike is that it's quite difficult to get off, even with using an eyemakeup remover. It's quite a task at the end of the day to get it off completely because I put on many coats.

  AFTER: As I have dry skin, I personally do not prefer to use soap because it makes my skin more drier. I have previously tried their Mud Soap which i loved using it.That's why I expected a lot about this soap as well. To be honest, I am slightly disappointed about this soap! I know many people like this soap and even saw some videos where they used it directly on the face!! I can finally tell you that this soap works just like the regular body soap.It does clean very well,although it dries my skin like hell! I dare to use it on my face though! It smell nice like regular soap and this soap last for a long time i guess because it still in my bathroom! &#9786; One more thing I would like to mention that I use to wash my clothes with this soap, lol! and it does clean well and smell good as well.Overall, I think this soap works just like regular soap and kinda dry me out.So I would probably not going to repurchase it again!

  AFTER: I have thick, coarse, wavy hair to the middle of my back...that I like to wear straight. My old hair dryer would take a good 20-30 minutes to dry it, and that was with me brushing and pulling and exerting some effort. So imagine my wondrous surprise when this hair dryer did the same job in about 10 minutes--no lie! And it is SO light!!I do agree with some of the other reviewers that the buttons are not placed very well (although I only accidentally turned it off once), and I have to say that I wish the "cold shot" button was able to lock in the "on" position (like my last dryer did).I tested the sound against my old dryer (probably five years old, but the same wattage and also ionic), and they were about the same, but the Revlon is much lighter and dries the hair much faster. The air stream did seem a bit higher, but that was fine with me since I need that for my hair. And overall, my hair looked the same as it did with my old dryer.So, for a new mom with not much time for hairstyles, this hair dryer is a winner. It only gets knocked down to 4 stars because of the button placement and the cold-shot button.

  AFTER: I opened the package in the car and my husband exclaimed, "What is it?  It smells like something my Great Aunt Mildred would wear!"  FYI: He never was a fan of how she smelled.  The good thing is, it smells strong, but it doesn't not smell strong on my face (or hands that I use to lather my face).This can be used as a face and body soap.  I have only used it on my face, and will continue to only use it on my face, as after three days of using it, I have already noticed a difference.  My skin is naturally very dry and breaks out with most products.  I stopped using other products several days before using this so that I would know how the Dead Sea Salt worked.I have noticed the biggest difference in my complexion.  I would recommend this to anyone that has redness or an uneven skin tone.

  AFTER: I've been using IBD Just Gel for almost 2 years with my LED lamp at home. I adore this shade 'My Babe;' which is an opaque creme lilac/lavender. This shade coordinates well with 2014's color of the year 'Radiant Orchid.' It's versatile, being a medium light hue. It's a fun option and a very hip, tasteful Wes Anderson palette lavender - meaning a touch of retro appeal in a subdued hue in comparison to some Easter egg brights I've had before. I'm wearing it a lot this early Spring already. All I had in a lavender hue from IBD before was 'Amethyst Surprise' which is a semi-sheer frost with more neutral blue/grey tones and appeared darker with metallic highlights in appearance. This is my favorite gel lavender.

  AFTER: Something was just off about my appearance when I was using Very Black (or whatever the darkest black shade is). I'm Asian and my hair is a very dark brown with a reddish warm hue, so even though subtle, the blackest black shades just looked a bit artificial. This Black Brown shade is amazing. I love that my makeup looks softer, more natural, and without any clumps in sight - are they natural? Is she wearing mascara? I love it. The brush is just perfect, too - very rarely make mistakes and I manage to get every hair I want to. Sometimes reaching the hairs near the corners can be frustrating with other types of brushes, but this gets every one, and I don't end up with clumps in the process!

  AFTER: I don't believe there are any miracles in face creams, despite what the marketers would like us to believe.  At 62, I swear I have tried everything in the department stores, including Creme de la Mer, and most of what is in the drugstore.  What it finally came down to was something that was adequately moisturizing but not greasy, and above all, non-irritating.  My favorite daily moisturizer is the Regenerist Serum without fragrance, and I use this one at night because it is heavier and a good moisturizer for the night.  This cream is soothing, non-irritating despite having a bit of fragrance (hardly any).  I'm quite pleased with it, and will buy it again.  Is it as good as a $150 face cream?  I'd say yes, it is.  Olay also makes many of the big department store brands, by the way.  I've bought Lancome, Lauder, Chanel, Clinique, many others, and with many I had skin irritations, couldn't use them and returned them.So this cream meets my criteria for a good face cream and the price is right!  I use the Olay Pro-X cleansing brush at night, followed by this cream and my skin looks great, I don't know of anything better than this cream and you certainly don't need to spend more.  As for the "micro-sculpting" aspect of it...don't believe it.  If you want to improve your skin, use Retin A, good sunscreen, moderate your drinking of alcohol, don't smoke, and take good care of your skin by cleansing it properly and moisturizing when necessary (it gets more necessary as you get older).  I can say for a fact that what you do in your youth determines how your skin looks when you get older.  If you severely damage your skin, there are no miracle creams out there, don't get fooled into believing that.

  AFTER: I love this product, it feels so natural and the scent is great, although a little stronger than I prefer for my facial skin (I am sensitive to fragrances).Oh how I loved testing out the Dead Sea Salt Soapfollow for this review. If you&#8217;ve been following me for a while, you know that I have loved Dead Sea Salt products that I have used in the past, well this product is no different!The bar of soap arrived to my house from my Amazon order and I opened up the box to see a lovely blue colored bar of soap. The fragrance of the soap is quite refreshing, though a little more fragrance than I usually enjoy in my soap. The texture of the bar of soap is unusual, in that it feels a little bit textured to the touch especially while washing with it, the bar is not shiny like most commercial bar soaps, the look and texture is like a good bar of homemade soap.Dead Sea Salt does contain a lot of minerals and the Dead Sea has been though to have many health and beauty benefits for ages, even Cleopatra loved the benefits of the Dead Sea thousands of years ago. Today we are lucky as products come out with Dead Sea Salts in them so we can experience some of the benefits without traveling to the Dead Sea ourselves. The problem is some of the products that claim to be Dead Sea Salt products don&#8217;t contain enough of the Dead Sea Salt to make a difference at all in your skin.  With this Soap, I find that their claims are not only believable but that is has helped to settle down some of my skin problems, yes my recent flare has my rash back on some of my body and my face right now, however the Dead Sea Salt has seemed to settle down the Lupus skin flare up.I did use the Dead Sea Salt Soap on my face once in the shower and I have to say that it did leave my face squeaky clean to the touch and with a very light moisturized feeling. However my preferred, since my face is so very highly sensitive to fragrance, is to use it on my body. I really loved sudsing up my washcloth with this bar of soap, the resulting suds were small, soft and had a very gentle fragrance. After rinsing, just like on my face, the result was squeaky clean yet lightly moisturized.Now usually after using anything with Dead Sea Salts in it, I recommend rinsing well and then applying moisturizer&#8230; with this soap I recomend rinsing well and the moisturizer is your choice. The Dead Sea Salt Soap is made for Normal to Dry Skin  (and of course skin in between). For me? I rinsed well and the I still did moisturize, most of the time. When I didn&#8217;t moisturize my terribly dry skin on my legs showed dry flaking, so just when too worn out to bother moisturizing, I just hid those legs. lolThank you to Adovia Skin Care for allowing me to review their Dead Sea Salt Soap, I am so in love! Thank you again!

  AFTER: This mascara goes on cleanly and, as the product promises, without clumps.  It removes easily and doesn't smear too much.  It doesn't make short lashes (like mine) long, but at least they're not all clumped up.

Very profuse sweating but not too much.  buy it you will love it forever ...as i have.  i get the 32 ounce bottle.  it softens skin on hands and feet also ...  No success using it on my hair or face.  It was a bit irritating. blessings

  AFTER: I've been obsessed with my DIY gel nail kit that I got for my birthday and have already accumulated five colors (two Sephora by OPI, one Sally Hansen, and two IBD). To be honest, I prefer the formulation of IBD the best. I find that I have to do three coats (as opposed to two coats with the OPI and Sally Hansen). In terms of removal, I'd say they're all pretty much the same...As for the color itself (Sparkling Embers), I'd say it's a pale rosy gold - almost like champagne! Although there's definitely glitter, the color is subtle enough for me to wear to work (and I work in a pretty conservative commercial real estate office). The thin formulation allows you to pick exactly how much color you want on your nails (rather than just glombing it on all at once).When I first purchased this product, the shipping calculation said seven business days, but it was actually delivered exactly a week after I ordered it. As a long time Prime member, I'm used to the (almost) instant gratification of two-day shipping, but this was definitely worth the wait!

  AFTER: I've suffered for years from hand eczema and dry winter skin. Nothing I've tried has worked until I used this body wash. I looked for it after I saw amazing results in my daughter's eczema usingAveeno Baby Soothing Relief Cream Wash, 12 Ounce. In her case, we found the new detergent base inDove Bar Soap, Sensitive Skin Unscented, 4 Ounce, 16 Countwas triggering rashes and horrible itching, to the point of bleeding. Other baby washes, such asJohnson's Baby Bath Head to Toe Baby Wash, 28 Ounce (Pack of 2)were drying as well. With the Aveeno cream wash, her skin cleared up almost completely. It also works well as a mild baby shampoo.I've since tried other Aveeno products, includingAveeno Nourish + Moisturize Shampoo, 10.5 OunceandAveeno Nourish + Moisturize Conditioner, 10.5 Ounce, and saw a dramatic improvement in my dry flyaway hair in just three uses. Prior to that I had been using Pantene products and was resigned to having bad hair days.I had thought my dry skin and flyaway hair were just the result of pregnancies and getting older. But these Aveeno products all claim to do what they advertise. For the first time in years my skin is soft and my hair smooth. Even my husband noticed. Amazing :)

  AFTER: Update: nowhere on this package does it say Night Cream. I didn't know this was a night cream until I saw a magazine ad. I'm disappointed I didn't know because now I have a cupboard full of night stuff and nothing for the day. The only downside to buying Olay products is the lack of directions for use across the board. I think they need to update their packaging to include some directions.I don't have problem skin, and I've always taken good care of it. So, it's not like I've gone from non-existent skin care to trying a product and seeing great results. However, since switching to the Olay brand, I've noticed simply fantastic results. I'm in my 30's, and this product helps reduce the onslaught of tiny wrinkles and age spots that have started to invade my face. I have parched skin, and usually the thickest of hardcore moisturizers don't even do the trick. With this, though it doesn't say it's specifically for dry skin, a small amount does the trick every time (I do use a Regenerist serum underneath, so that could be one reason it works so well). I didn't even notice a heavy fragrance until reading reviews, so that isn't a deterrent for me. I love how soft and smooth my skin feels. I look radiant even sans makeup. I've never been able to say that about my skin since it tends to look dull and lifeless.My only complaint is it doesn't have an SPF. That's a real downer for me since I have extremely fair skin and absolutely have to wear sunscreen when I leave my house. And, with my skin looking refreshed and dewy, I can go without foundation more often. I do not like having to swap it out with another moisturizer that has an SPF on the days I forgo makeup. But then, this is my first time using the Olay brand, so who knows, maybe there is a great moisturizer in this line that has SPF.Overall, even without the SPF, I recommend this. I love the results I've seen with this brand, especially since I wasn't expecting it to perform any better than the other brands I've used.

  AFTER: I needed a dryer just to keep at our cabin, so I wanted something cheaper that still worked well. I had decent luck with a Revlon dryer before so I went with this model. This is cheap, but does not work well at all. The power cord gets hotter than the dryer. It is surprisingly loud, even for a hair dryer. It takes at least 3 times the amount of time to dry my hair compared to my Rusk dryer, and twice as longer than an older Revlon dryer I have as a spare. Until a few days ago, I had almost waist length hair. I do understand that longer hair takes longer to dry, but this took 30 minutes and I gave up before completely dry. My arm hurt. What really chaps my pants is that I paid almost $30 for this at Ulta. Unfortunately, the exchange period closed before I got to the cabin to use this, so I am stuck with it. If I didn't cut my hair to shoulder length recently, I would probably just throw this away and spend the extra money on another Rusk.

  AFTER: I get really dry skin, especially in the wintertime.  I'm sure you're excited and curious which parts of my body experience the dryness, right?  Well let me ease your delights!  Under my ears is the main spot.  In fact that's the main reason I bought skin cream to begin with.  Flakey, crusty skin that peels on my lobes, on both ears.  Skin also peels on the back of my ears.  It's sort of annoying.  Another popular spot is on the sides and back of my neck.  I will wake up and see balls of dry skin on my bed linen that will absolutely *have* to be shaken off.  This Aveeno lotion helps quite a bit.  Applying enough lotion around bedtime will ensure that by morning my skin will be healthy and improved. My lips also get crusty but I have chapstick to take care of that one.  My forehead and the tip of my nose are two other frequent skin-peeling locations.  Aveeno skin lotion will fix whatever's ailing your skin, guaranteed.

  AFTER: It's a good mascara, but I do not see much difference between different brands. Mascara is mascara. This one has a nasty "bulb" of black stuff at the tip every time you take the brush out, but a lot of them do. Other than that it's a regular mascara, works just fine.

Well what they said about the new ones was correct. This really does dry your hair in half the time. It is better for your hair, as it dries your hair with less heat! Not sure how that works, but it does. Highly recommend this product!

It gets pretty sudsy when you use a loofah too! I was a little worried that showering multiple times a day (sometimes even 3 times due to activities) that my skin would get super dry. Luckily this soap is true to it's word though and kept my skin hydrated and moisturized.

  AFTER: I preface this review by saying that I've been using night cream for years and have fairly good skin (except for the areas around my eyes).  That said, I'm not sure this cream is any better than Regenerist Nightly Moisturizer.  I switched over because of all of the hype but haven't noticed any real difference or improvement.  For those who are just starting a nightly moisturizer routine, this cream may be better than the less expensive Nightly Moisturizer.  But, I think I'll switch back.  Both products are excellent.

  AFTER: There is a deep wrinkle between my eyebrows I've used this on and on my neck and I do notice an improvement in the wrinkles when I use this regularly which is about 2-4 times a week. It doesn't hurt just a little prickly feeling, just go slow and roll back and forth 3-4 times then lift and move to the next spot.  However when I use this between my eyebrows at the top of my nose it does make me sneeze, but that could just be me.

  AFTER: I admit it.  I was really skeptical about this crazy thing.  Now, I can't live without it.  It is a little pinchy on the skin when you roll it, (sometimes it makesme sneeze when I do between the brow area)  but it opens up my pores and lets the product absorb down into the skin so effectively!!  My skin is luminous when I go to bed and refreshed in the morning when I awake.  I love it, It is of good quality and the price was FANTASTIC! I am hooked.  Thank you to the seller for the fantastic price, and the super fast delivery.

  AFTER: I use a lot of natural oils, and castor oil is a regular player. Keep in mind it can be drying on its own so it needs to be mixed with a carrier oil-I use sweet almond oil and put a few drops of lavender oil in as well. It is a little thicker than some oils but once mixed it is fine. I can already see my over-plucked eyebrows growing back and plan on using it as a hair/scalp treatment as well. I noticed some have complained about the smell, but I have barely noticed it-sort of a light nutty smell. Just mix a few drops of essential oil in and you can have whatever scent you want. Lavender oil is also good for hair growth so I use that.

  AFTER: Well, if you say this roller doesn't hurt, you are kidding yourself. It does hurt, a lot too. However, this is when you apply pressure. But, if you keep it within the same area, the pain lessens. I was excited to receive this based on other reviews and my own personal research. I have since used the product about five times. At first, I used it a couple of times every other day, then I started waiting a week in between rolling. Your face does feel like you got a sunburn afterwards. Some people say it goes away within an hour, for me, it takes at least a day. After 24 hours, my skin looks plumped up. Although, it appears to get back to normal after three days (or two). I think it's working, but I can't be 100% sure. My skin seems to look better than it did when I first used it. I'm going to keep working with this. I have tried many other ways to boost collagen, so as long as I follow instructions, I don't see how it can hurt.

  AFTER: I love the heavy mascara but I am careful to remove excess by 'batting my eyelashes&#34; against a tissue both by looking up and down.  That removes the excess and lets it dry carefully.  Still have to separate those eyelashes sometimes, though.  Still, can't beat the coverage.

  AFTER: I bought this mascara basically pretty much out of curiosity. I saw rave reviews saying how they make your lashes look spectacular and long and luscious. But in reality it's practically the same stuff you get at the drug store. I used this about 3-5 times since I got it and somehow it makes your lashes really hard and it makes me lose lashes, and unfortunately it makes my eyes itch sometimes which results in the lashes to join together and make them look worst. I do give it credit it does go on great and makes you have nice lashes but I'd say try it out for yourself. Because not everyone will have the same experience with mascara and let alone makeup.

  AFTER: This light weight dryer dries my hair quickly without frying it due to the Warm setting on high.  I've been buying Tourmaline / Ionic dryers for years and would not consider buying any other.  It's quieter than my other dryers too.  I like the defuser for days when I want to go with my natural curly look without having to wait for it to air dry.  It's a steal on Amazon compared to my $100 dryers that do the same thing.  I was intending on leaving this one at my son's home when I visit him, but after using it I brought it back home with me and will leave another of my high priced dryers there the next time I visit.

  AFTER: i haven't used any needle roller before and I did try it once, I don't think I even punctured my skin, I was barely touching it on my face and it was a little too much for me, but I am a sissy with pain. So I ordered the 0.5mm size and that one I can tolerate and do properly. Just remember to clean face and hands good, always use clean/disinfected roller. I just used the bleach and water solution and soak it for 10 mins, but just bought some alcohol and will be using the alcohol to disinfect it a little.When rolling, roll in one direction, someone recommended to just roll once direction, then lift and roll again. I did try that roll once, but now I get the hang of it, I can roll on the same area without moving the roller to much, repeat 8-10 tiems. When you move the roller while rolling it can potentially cut your face so please be careful. You will notice your face turning red and some areas where its not too red, then I just go over that area with a roller again. I had been doing this for 2 weeks now so haven't really noticed a significant change. But I can tell that when I applied the Hyaluronic with C & E, it really gets soaked up right away and my skin is softer. Also I was doing the peel and had noticed some chages on my pores, getting smaller, yeeey! So I really dont know whats working, but Im sure its the combination of Peel, Roller and Hyaluronic acid.

I will be using this one on my butt to see if it finally gets rid of my tiger claw stretch marks lol*UPDATE 11/04/13Well this was def a piece of garbage on my facial skin. Ever since i rolled this crap on my face my skin has never been the same. My skin is still slowly recovering its scary! My face shows large pores and black dots which appears to be black heads throughout my face from my cheeks to my forehead to my chin :(It is really disappointing. Also it appears as if i have developed rosacea on my left cheek since there are two small spots looking pinkish purpleish and a bit swollen. This really makes me mad!! It has gotten better simply because i have been very persistent on my daily facial regimen care with natural products and scrubbing. This item will never again touch my face!! I havent even tried it on my butt for stretch marks like i said i would because im anxious it will get worst! If i ever develop the balls to try it there i will update whether for better or for worst, lets hope for the better if taken the chance!

  AFTER: I've used this on my hands,legs,and arms now for years and absolutely love it.  Not greasy, smelly, or too thick.  It glides on so pleasantly and keeps me moisturized. I keep a travel size in my purse.

  AFTER: it shipped fast, and was as promised.  i love that it's lightweight and can dry my thick, curly, long hair in about 10 mins (which is about 20 mins faster than my last blow dryer) without causing frizzies (when using the diffuser, which was included, along with a concentrator) or my arms needing a break.  the only time i've had my hair dried faster was at Gene Juarez with what i'm assuming is much more expensive equipment.  for under $30 i can live with the toggle buttons where they are.  i turned it off once by accident, and just repositioned my hand after that and it was not an issue.

  AFTER: I purchased this from a seller that offers free shipping and the price was something like under $7. Considering that this price is about what I pay at Target or some other similar store, I think it's reasonable. The brush shape is different than any of mine and it works well because it gets those lashes on the inner and outer aspects at the same time you are applying the center. The consistency is dry but this is not a bad thing, it doesn't tend to form big clumps on the brush or your lashes, and you should apply coats in succession as if you are brushing your lashes as this works best. The other thing I love is that it does not give me raccoon eyes thought it washes off completely with soap and water! I have used a lot of mascaras, the worst was Falsies, which was like pure goop. The best "base" mascara is Great Lash because it's very thin and sort of separates lashes for another mascara but alone is not enough for me. So I typically use Maybelline's Soft and something but they are back on the animal testing list. I find that this works close enough and it doesn't have the drawbacks mentioned. I don't have to use my Elf eye make-up pen to remove smeary mascara half-way through work.

  AFTER: This is not a solid glittery color as you'd think.  It goes on like a clear polish with some glitter.  It would probably take 10 coats to make it solid like on the package.  It might be cute over the top of the Mischievous Mango color though.  IBD as a brand though is great.  Long lasting, goes on smooth, and the bottle design doesn't make a huge mess like the Gelish does.  Who doesn't like being about to buy 2 colors for the price of 1 of the other brands too!?

Great price too.

  AFTER: The heat and cool air is wonderful, I like the cold blast button. There's an indicator light for the ions working like they should. It's attractive in color and style, as far as blow dryers are concerned. It comes with a point attachment and a diffuser. It has three temperatures and the cold blast. The air flow is sufficient, and the heat is not too hot so it burns but hot enough it dries quickly. I've noticed a lot less frizz in my curly hair and my best friend borrowed it and she has super fine straight hair and had it blow dry smooth without any static when she borrowed it.If I had but one complaint, and it's really a minor one: the product 'feels' cheap. i worry a little bit that it's not going to be sturdy over the long haul if I drop it or knock it around.Other than that, I like how it looks, it's light enough it's easy to hold, and I like how it works. I'd definitely recommend it, but I also recommend treating it carefully, because it does look like it won't take a beating very well. if you travel a lot of are hard on appliances like this, you might want to find one a bit 'sturdier' feeling.But I think you'll be pleased with how it does your hair and it's worth the price.

  AFTER: This is nice mascara.  It has a nice curved wand.  No, it doesn't clump up.  Yes, it colored my lashes to a darker hue.  Other than that, I really don't see much difference between it andCoverGirl LashBlastFusion Mascara Very Black 860, 13.1 ml, 1 Tube.  Outside, of course, of the fact that this comes in a green container, and LashBlast is purple.Neither type of mascara did anything spectacular as far as I could see in terms of adding volume to my lashes.

  AFTER: I'm a fan of Cover Girl products because they work well and aren't overly expensive.  This mascara doesn't disappoint - it goes on smoothly with the brush and doesn't clump on my lashes.  I like that it colors and defines my lashes without thickening them too much, since I'm a little too old to pull off a dramatic super-huge-eyelash look.This mascara stays on all day without flaking or ending up smeared under my eyes, and it washes off easily with soap and water or cold cream.My only complaint is the odd shape of the container.  It's small on one end and top heavy so it wants to fall over, and angled at the other end so it can't stand on that end either.  And it's too fat in diameter to fit in the openings of my makeup case.  I do like the bright green color, since that makes it easy to find in a purse.

  AFTER: I'm super picky about my mascara and have used the same brand forever but after trying this it is now my new fave!  The brush is really good not your typical super bristly kind.

  AFTER: I have lots of IBD colors.  And, I love them.  This one, not so much.  It went on really thin.  It took 4 coats to get the true yellow color and by then it was neon in shade.  I will use it but only in a design like half and half with another color or on one finger with art.  It's not something I would wear on all 10 fingers.

  AFTER: I ordered this product with the hope that it could help with a few white stretch marks on my hips. Note that I have had these marks since I was 13 years old and I am now 29 so the thought of finally minimizing them was worth the try. I did alot of research before I started and followed it religiously giving my skin enough time to heal and benefit from the rolls.I followed the rolling with a natural mixture of shea butter and coconut oil. Though the whole process is a little painful, its bearable and women go through much worse with waxing etc.Unlike others, I did not roll to the point of bleeding. Also ensure that you sanitize and store the product properly between uses.Its not a miracle product but after a few weeks I noticed that the stretch marked skin was smooth and you could no longer feel the indents from the mark itself ( they were still visible).This to me was the most improvement I have ever had in them having tried several creams and scrubs before. My problem with this product is that the needles go dull too quickly. I have ordered two times and both had to be discarded after a few uses. I really wish it was more durable.I will try this type of product again but maybe from a different brand.

  AFTER: LOVED this one! It's nearly gone since I used it every day for about a month (and more than one time a day while on vacation).This soap definitely did it's job in removing dirt! It gets pretty sudsy when you use a loofah too! I was a little worried that showering multiple times a day (sometimes even 3 times due to activities) that my skin would get super dry. Luckily this soap is true to it's word though and kept my skin hydrated and moisturized.

  AFTER: I apply a few drops of the serum to my "trouble spots (around eyes, mouth - laugh lines, and forehead-in between brows)" every other day and I feel it makes a big difference in smoothing out fine lines. It seems like it helps with collagen boosting too. I feel like I'm just barely starting to discover signs of aging at 31 years old, and it may be my entire skin care routine that's helping. This stuff does sting a bit (especially if I use it after derma-rolling - OUCH!), and it smells like burnt nuts, but it is working for me. I've been using it for 2 1/2 months and I keep the little bottles in the fridge. I'll definitely re-order this when I'm out!

  AFTER: I've always had a problem with mascara clumping. A trick I learned from a makeup artist is to very gently roll the wand in a tissue before applying; it works. This mascara is really good at NOT clumping right out of the bottle. However, it doesn't seem to build & lengthen my lashes as much as my L'Oreal Voluminous mascara. I needed to apply 2 coats to get my lashes thick looking (like the L'Oreal does in one coat) and after doing that, my lashes were mostly uncurled. I've always felt that the CoverGirl mascaras are too wet/thin. They tend to make my eyelashes "uncurl"/straighten out after curling & applying the mascara. This new formula is better than others but still uncurls.The positive part is this mascara did not clump even with 2 coats. But, my nicely curled lashes were no longer very curled. It does wear well; minimal flaking & no smudge after a long day. So I guess if you prefer minimal thickening/lengthening of your eyelashes, this would be a good product for you. I'm not sure I'll keep using it because I prefer a thicker looking lash but it is a good mascara & worth a try if you've had problems with clumping.

  AFTER: I got this because I had to switch up a lot of my normal products when I became pregnant. I had heard this was safe for pregnancy and wrote Olay who assured me that all of their products are safe for pregnant women to use. The texture is nice and it does help moisturize and doesn't seem to break me out. Normally I prefer a retinol cream by Neutrogena but I can't use retinol products while pregnant. This has been a nice substitution. I will probably switch back once I am able but for now it was nice to find something that is safe to use, helps with my dry skin and is effective.

  AFTER: Got it in the mail yesterday and put it to work last night. Reviewers who said it was painful were not joking. I have a high pain tolerance but man, that thing HURTS. I was really fighting back those tears! I also had to take mini-breaks.I tried not to add any pressure but then the wheel wouldn't spin and the needles ended up scratching my face. Imagine rubbing a cactus on your face. OUCH!! So I put just enough pressure to get the roller going and it kept squeaking big time. Did not sound good. I wished the roller was better lubricated so I wouldn't have to use ANY pressure. Then it wouldn't have been so bad. Maybe that's why some people are saying it didn't hurt?My face got red and warm,just like a sun-burn. I was kind of scared at first because I read (afterwards) that it can cause melasma and hyperpigmentation to darken. I was hoping to LIGHTEN melasma/hyperpigmentation, some very fine lines and very few acne scars. Next time I 'll go a lot easier on the pigmented areas and focus more on the lines and scars. Hopefully I can stir up enough courage to do this again in a couple of weeks.Woke up this morning and my face felt soft but dry and warm. It was still red and felt like a sun-burn. Put on all natural moisturizing/repair serums and sunscreen after my morning shower. Up close my face still looked painful but from a distance I had a really nice "sun-kissed glow." It was quite pretty. Like I was wearing a really pretty blush.Well that's all I can say about this roller for now. Hopefully once my face heels fully, I'll see and feel a little more improvement.

  AFTER: I was really excited about this mascara after reading all the good reviews, but it didn't turn out to be as good as I was hoping. The biggest problem is that IT WEIGHS DOWN my lashes, which is the most annoying thing for me. I don't have natural curvy eyelashes like some girls do, so I have to curl my lashes and hope that my mascara will hold the curve. That's the most important thing in a mascara I think, the ability to hold up lashes, not to weigh them down. NYX doll eye mascara does give my lashes volume and my lashes look fuller, but I just can't deal with the fact that my lashes are pointing down after applying this mascara. I'm very disappointed, but I do think if you have curvy eyelashes, this can be good for you. It's very black, and it does add volume.

Then I tried it on my overlay and it was tacky, much more tacky than other brands.It dries at a normal paceThe shine is a great luster shineSuggestions:Remember to use rubbing alcohol once you set the UV coat to remove the excess product build up and to remove the tackiness. Apply a really, really thin layer to get the best results.If you are looking a for a Top coat for your solar nails, natural nails and or overlays without polish this is a great product.If you are looking for a Top coat that will seal and secure ANY Polish..try Gelish or Seche brands.

  AFTER: I heard many great things about this brand so I decided to order one after trying the ZGTS brand. First off, this roller is waaaaaaaay less painful than the ZGTS. Even though I am using 1.0 from this brand and used 1.5 for the ZGTS, the length of the needles have nothing to do with the pain level at all. The ZGTS needles are really tough and painful due to them being made out of titanium steel which is supposely suppose to help the needles last longer which is complete bull! The needles are also placed different so you have some cross action rows going on. I will give it another month or two to see if it works for me and will definitely lower my rating if I dont see any improvements to my skin.

  AFTER: After years of buying a $25 a tube mascara, I'm going back to Covergirl.  This mascara is pretty great.  The wand has very stiff ridges that comb through your lashes as you apply it.  It's basically impossible to clump.  It also gave my lashes great lift without having to use an eyelash curler, and even by the end of the day, my lashes were still lifted...that never happens.  The formula is thin, so if your looking for crazy volume, this isn't going to deliver.  But for extreme definition and lift, this mascara is fantastic.

  AFTER: This Just Gel polish would not cure properly and smelled strongly of solvent. Apparently someone who had the bottle before me attempted to thin it with remover or nail polish thinner. Pure gel polishes shouldn't have a strong odor and even though I understand dark colors can be trickier and take longer to cure, they should still cure after a reasonable time to the same glossy, hard finish as any other gel polish color. Mine left a thick film of uncured, pigmented polish, and the part that cured was dull and porous. I had the same problem with some clearance Gelishes from Sally Beauty. I was new to gel polishes at the time and imagine my frustration trying to get them to work!I will still buy this product again, because it's obvious the one I got was defective or tampered in some way.Purchased from Beauty Chain, who immediately approved the return, though I still need to research how to legally ship back a nail polish containing a flammable substance.Update 2014-02-22: Amazon (not BeautyChain) credited me for the purchase after I explained the dilemma, and they didn't require me to mail it back.

Basically I wash my face as usual, disinfect this with some rubbing alcohol, let it dry, and run it over my face and neck. I haven't wanted to press too hard, it does feel uncomfortable as you would expect, but it still pierces the skin. I follow it with the Cosmetic Skin Solutions 20% Vitamin C etc from here, stings for a second but quickly goes away. Next morning, my skin looks great. I've been doing it about twice a week, which seems to be a good frequency. I have noticed the occasional pimple after, not sure it's a causal relationship but probably my disinfecting routine could use some work. This thing is so cheap if you're thinking about it, I'd just try it. Just be sure to have a good disinfectant for before each use and serum for after.

  AFTER: I'm not sure this thing works but I'm sure it is a bit painful. I'm also not surprised that Angelina Jolie is one of the folks who endorses it....she looks like she's might be into a little pain from time to time, I'm not. If you don't mind feeling like you've gotten a wind burn, you might like to use this small instrument of torture and maybe it will exfoliate or something but I've found no evidence of anything beneficial in my case.

  AFTER: I have been doing gel polish on my nails at home for 3 years now and I have used almost ALL the brands (I am not a nail tech). I LOVE the price of this brand, and it wears and goes on just as perfect as all the expensive brands.  I have NO problems with peeling or chipping....maybe that is because I put the product on right.

  AFTER: Let me start by saying that I do not use night creams, and I do not use this product regularly.  I use it as my Winter time  moisturizer when I go out at night.  I don't use it during the day because it doesn't have any SPF.  Therefore, I can't comment on its long term effects.  But I have to say, it does have pretty decent instant effects.  It does plump up my facial lines and wrinkles, and minimizes them better than any other drugstore wrinkle cream I have used so far. (And I have tried several).  I will most likely purchase this again.

  AFTER: I've had all kinds of skin treatments. Thermage, Fraxel, Cosmelon, Alpha Hydroxyl Acid Peels, even a couple of Jessner Peels and I used to use Retin-A. So far, this Needle Roller has been one of the most effective and least expensive things I've tried yet. I read up on it before purchasing and in some cases people have paid as much as $100 for one of these gadgets, so the price was really the main thing that attracted me. I chose the 1.00mm size as it was stated elsewhere that the larger 1.5mm and up will puncture the skin too deeply and cause bleeding. This size seems to be perfect. It abrades the skin enough so that serums (I use Skinbiology Copper with it) will penetrate and be more effective. The abrasion also triggers a "healing response" in the skin, so age spots, scars, etc. (which I consider to be a result of "incomplete healing") have a chance to further heal and diminish or go away entirely. I clean my roller after each use by squirting rubbing alcohol over it and drying off the excess with a blow dryer. It comes in a handy clear plastic case for storage that prevents the needles from touching anything so they remain clean and won't bend. You roll it on an area back and forth about 20 times each direction. Not the most pleasant sensation, it feels like a cactus rubbing on my skin. You can use a numbing cream with it, which I haven't tried yet--but I will. It causes a reddening similar to a sunburn that is usually gone by morning when I use it at night. Otherwise I am able to cover it with some concealer (I use either GloMinerals Camouflage or Eve Pearl Salmon Concealer). I noticed the very next day, after the 1st use, how much younger and better my skin looked. I've also been using it on the back of my hands and they are also looking younger as a result. I have a DPL and a Lightstim that I use twice a day (both) and I think that ALL of this combined, Derma Roller, Copper Serum, high quality cosmetics and LED red light therapy are a MUCH more effective and extremely affordable way to improve the appearance of my skin, especially in comparison to the $$$ I wasted at the dermatologist's office on the treatments I had (was talked into). And it's done in a slow, subtle way that is probably better in the long run for my skin.

  AFTER: I have very puny lashes and this mascara made my lashes look thick and amazing!  So just imagine how much it would enhance thicker fuller lashes.  I consider this mascara a 'must-have' from now on and will not be without it.

  BEFORE: <none>
  AFTER: This is definitely one of the better mascaras I've tried in a long time. It goes on smooth, so clumps are pretty hard to get (unless maybe you put on more than two thick coats) and it adds volume to the lashes. Although it's not waterproof, I wore it out in the snow/rain much of the day and in the evening there wasn't a single smudge. That never happened with the other mascara I used. The mascara removed easily with a regular eye make up remover. I have sensitive eyes and many mascaras cause my eyes to become itchy or they dry out my lashes. I didn't have either of those problems with this mascara. So far, this one's a winner.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE 2/25/13: After using this mascara a few months now, I still like it, but I've changed my rating to 4 stars instead of 5 because although there aren't really any clumps, it tends to flake a little or smudge later in the day.

  AFTER: I purchased this from a seller that offers free shipping and the price was something like under $7. Considering that this price is about what I pay at Target or some other similar store, I think it's reasonable. The brush shape is different than any of mine and it works well because it gets those lashes on the inner and outer aspects at the same time you are applying the center. The consistency is dry but this is not a bad thing, it doesn't tend to form big clumps on the brush or your lashes, and you should apply coats in succession as if you are brushing your lashes as this works best. The other thing I love is that it does not give me raccoon eyes thought it washes off completely with soap and water! I have used a lot of mascaras, the worst was Falsies, which was like pure goop. The best "base" mascara is Great Lash because it's very thin and sort of separates lashes for another mascara but alone is not enough for me. So I typically use Maybelline's Soft and something but they are back on the animal testing list. I find that this works close enough and it doesn't have the drawbacks mentioned. I don't have to use my Elf eye make-up pen to remove smeary mascara half-way through work.

  AFTER: I was lucky to get to try out the Adovia Moisturizing Mineral Soap. I love the smell of it as well as the way it leaves my skin smooth and moisturized. I honestly didn't find a con to this soap at all, I did notice a few pimples that popped up a day or so after use but I would have to say that is probably due to the salt pulling the impurities out of my skin. I will continue to use this bar of soap and update my blog review once the bar is used up! I have super sensitive skin so knowing I didn't have an allergic reaction to this wonderful soap just makes me love it even more.

  AFTER: I have tried just about everything- and I mean EVERYTHING (I worked in skincare for several years and was able to try hundreds of products for free)- and this is the one and only thing that 1) made any difference whatsoever on my pitted acne scarring (and a big difference at that)2) kept me from breaking out ONCE regardless of time of month or what I used on my face3) refined large pores and evened tone on my faceI couldn't believe how much it turned my skin around. I had redness, uneven tone, pitted scars and at least five or six blemishes at all times and after day two of using it, I had far less blemishes and less redness. By week two I had less scarring, smaller pores and no blemishes whatsoever. I have to say I've had NO issues with the quality of the product and I've used it every single day for two months. It still rolls just as well as it did the first time and it doesn't snag on skin at all. Works like new for me!

  AFTER: Cleansing every morning has become a spa like experience thanks to Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap. I work the Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap into a deep, rich lather and rub in small concentric circles around my face until it is completely covered in the Sea Salt Soap at which point I begin to rinse with cool to warm water until all traces of the soap have vanished.My skin has never felt so clean, and I am being completely honest with you when I tell you that washing my face has never been so pleasurable. I&#8217;ve used liquid face soap religiously for the past 10 years, at least, not a bar soap, but I am loving the results I&#8217;m getting from Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap. I used to only wash once per day, in the morning, because the liquid soap left my face feeling dry and tight, but with Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap, I wash morning and night.There is never a residue with Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap and my face feels refreshingly clean. Adovia&#8217;s bar soap lather is very light whereas the liquid soap I&#8217;d been using felt like there was always a layer left on my skin. I hadn&#8217;t noticed that leftover residue until I switched to Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap and I don&#8217;t think I will go back to a liquid cleanser again.The price point is right up my alley. At $11 a bar, I feel like I am getting this cleanser at a steal. Compared to other bar soaps I&#8217;ve used in the past as a cleanser, I don&#8217;t feel that they lathered as well or left me feeling as fresh and clean as Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap.Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap also has an amazingly clean fresh scent that you can smell before you even take it out of the box. I love awakening my senses to the smell of Adovia&#8217;s Dead Sea Salt Soap in the morning. It makes me feel like I am doing something good for my skin and feeling good in my skin couldn&#8217;t come at a better price.

It wasn't over powering, but just a very clean smell.  I used it in the shower that evening. I used it on my face, elbows and feet. It is a very gentle soap, and lathers up really well. The soap rinsed clean off of my skin, I felt no residue or drying to any of the areas I applied it to. I just felt clean. The smell stayed on my body for awhile, which since I loved the smell was awesome!It is far from your typical bar soap!  My feet feel amazing! I wear flip flops everyday and your feet can get dry and cracked, this soap has helped heal them. My heels are soft and smooth again.I have used several other Adovia products and they have yet to disappoint!

It doesn't smell like any kind of foody oil though...the scent isn't gross in my opinion. It's great for hair too, but I think it's amazing on skin. Helps with softening up underye bags.

  AFTER: After trying out the soap for myself I love the way my skin feels after; my skin feels clean, soft and hydrated. It doesn&#8217;t leave your skin feeling dry or scratchy but left my skin feeling smooth and soft. Not to mention I think the soap smells so good and fresh! It&#8217;s just one of those fresh scents that can truly be appreciated when you smell it. Also, I noticed that this soap doesn&#8217;t give the residue after effect that a lot of infused soaps do, which is a huge plus to me. I hate that residue after affect and avoid those soaps at all cost to be honest. Something else I noticed when I used this soap is that the exfoliation benefits are tremendous and instantly noticeable. I&#8217;m one who appreciates instant gratification so to see an immediately noticeable difference is again, a big deal for me. The one major thing though that really caught my attention about this soap is that the bar is solid. What I mean by that is that other moisturizing bars disintegrate whereas this bar is holding up well in the shower and so far not dissolving.Needless to say I&#8217;ve had a positive experience using the Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap bar. It works great, it&#8217;s high quality, and feels great! It&#8217;s also supposed to be good on sensitive skin as well, but I&#8217;m not so sensitive so I can&#8217;t vouch for that one. Not to mention it smells good. I definitely recommend the soap.

  AFTER: I enjoyed using this soap because it did leave my skin feeling very moisturized without feeling like it left a residue behind. I don't have to use tons of lotion afterwards because of how moisturizing it is, which is great (for my pocket as well as my skin). Personally, the smell wasn't too strong for my nose when I opened the box, but I did let it sit out for a couple of days before I actually used it so that might have calmed the scent down some. Overall I did enjoy using this soap.

  AFTER: I haven't been using this oil for long, but I am an instant devotee! About me: African American & Native American; natural, kinky curly hair; acne prone, dry skin; 28 years old.I tried this oil before, when I first stopped straightening my hair. I hadn't quite gotten acquainted to the needs of my hair at the time, and tried slathering it on with nothing else. That was a massive fail - it was too thick - no comb was getting through that!Fast forward two years, as I began the oil cleansing method (OCM) with good results, trying only coconut oil. During this time, I started to read how people love castor oil the most for the OCM, so I gave it a try again. This time as suggested by others, I mixed it 50/50 with a lighter oil to make it spreadable - extra virgin olive oil. The results were MAGICAL.My face instantly fell in love - removing all dirt, grime, make-up, dry skin, and leaving my face supple and delicious, and karate chopping the few acne spots I had. That lead me to trying it on my body as a moisturizer. OMG - DELICIOUS SKIN! Mind you, I have terribly flaky, dry legs. BE GONE, said the castor oil!Then I tried it on my kinky, curly hair - BUTTER! It made my hair softer than it has ever been in my entire life. My hair was in a good state already, but there was some minor breakage every time I detangled or manipulated my hair. Not any more!The best part about this - there is NO GREASINESS. I mean NONE! No more stains on the clothes, no more greasy head rests in the car... I am in awe!

  AFTER: A hair dryer review by a bald guy is somewhat amusing.  I bought this for my wife who luckily is not bald.  The dryer is quieter than her last one which was supposed to be quiet and certainly wasn't.  Quietness is very subjective while this is quieter I don't see how all you haired folks stand that noise for the length of time it takes to dry your hair.  This does a good job.

Any, if you want to spend half an hour trying to get some mascara on youreyelashes, and then don't get much for your effort, this mascara is for you. My advice, don't waste your time or yourmoney!

  AFTER: I love using jamaican black castor oil for a number of health & beauty purposes. Mainly, I use it (lightly) to moisturize my scalp post-shampoo. I also use it as a pre-shampoo deep conditioner along with some wheat germ oil and coconut oil. Aside from hair, a light dab moisturizes my face and skin. In the winter months, I apply some lightly to my lips for moisture and to fight chap. Oddly enough, this particular brand has been reported as having a &#34;smoky smell&#34; but I do not find it offensive. Maybe it could be the amount other apply??? To combat this, one could add essential oils like Lavendar.

  AFTER: I tend to have a terrible time with mascara. It either smears, clumps, gives me raccoon eyes, stings, or just doesn't do much. But this product lives up to the claims. It gave tremendous volume, and good length- with only one coat! It goes on clump free, doesn't make my eyes itch, and stays put all day. I was out in the wet for hours today, and there was not a trace of raccoon eye; yet it removes easily with soap and water.I have not tried it when wearing foundation, and it's been pretty cold, so I don't know how it'll do with oily skin/foundation, but I'm really hoping it holds up to that because this just became my new favorite mascara. The only complaint I have is the giant container, but I realize it probably has to be large to hold the curved brush.

  AFTER: I admit, I put on a ton just to test it and THEN it clumped a little, but normal use, no clumping, good for use with an eyelash curler, which I have to use, no black clumps on your curler. It's not screamingly perfect, but I'd say one of the best brand name mascaras I've tried. Definitely good value for your money!

  AFTER: I used to use Latisse, but it runs about $120.00 per month and, although I did see some improvement, it was not enough to justify the price. Then I discovered this product. After removing all makeup at night, I apply a bit to the lashes and lash line. I swear I see a difference - longer, thicker, and darker lashes. And it does not sting the eyes, or cause the slight skin discoloration that Latisse did.

  AFTER: While I was expecting a bright orange, I was somehow shocked by the revelation that this polish is not merely orange, it is traffic cone IN YOUR FACE orange. It's going to make a great polish for the summer - it looks a bit outlandish and whackadoodle in the cold winter months, but it's a great dupe to Tiki Tiki Laranga by Gelish, for half the price!I also bought Turtle Bay, and have loved it as well. It's a gorgeous teal, that leans more toward a blue than a green tone. It's going to be great for summer.I've been satisfied with the IBD polishes I've received so far, and absolutely love the prices. They last as long as gelish (which is usually until I get bored and soak them off!), and have such pretty, vibrant colors! At this time, I've been using them with the Gelish Foundation and Top It Off, and curing under an LED.

  AFTER: This was recommended as one of the top ten skin products in 2009, and I started using it at that time. I found it was a good skin cream, but my more expensive face cream was much better. I am not a fan of the scent.On recommendations of friends I tried the skin cream again, and within a week I found my skin breaking out at my chin line. I have not had issues with my skin since I was a teenager, some 50 odd years ago. I was aghast. I stopped using the cream, and my skin cleared within a few days.I must add that my daughter uses Olay Regenerist Cream, and she loves it. So, who knows what the problem is with my use. I per used other reviews just now, and found other women have had the same skin issues I have.

I have also used it on my eyelashes (careful with that though, it can get into your eyes) and seen them grow and on my dry skin and seen it glow (this is best for dry skin, my skin is combo so I can't use it too much on my face, only when necessary). I'm sure there are many wonders untold about this oil, I am still looking.

  AFTER: I love this product, it feels so natural and the scent is great, although a little stronger than I prefer for my facial skin (I am sensitive to fragrances).Oh how I loved testing out the Dead Sea Salt Soapfollow for this review. If you&#8217;ve been following me for a while, you know that I have loved Dead Sea Salt products that I have used in the past, well this product is no different!The bar of soap arrived to my house from my Amazon order and I opened up the box to see a lovely blue colored bar of soap. The fragrance of the soap is quite refreshing, though a little more fragrance than I usually enjoy in my soap. The texture of the bar of soap is unusual, in that it feels a little bit textured to the touch especially while washing with it, the bar is not shiny like most commercial bar soaps, the look and texture is like a good bar of homemade soap.Dead Sea Salt does contain a lot of minerals and the Dead Sea has been though to have many health and beauty benefits for ages, even Cleopatra loved the benefits of the Dead Sea thousands of years ago. Today we are lucky as products come out with Dead Sea Salts in them so we can experience some of the benefits without traveling to the Dead Sea ourselves. The problem is some of the products that claim to be Dead Sea Salt products don&#8217;t contain enough of the Dead Sea Salt to make a difference at all in your skin.  With this Soap, I find that their claims are not only believable but that is has helped to settle down some of my skin problems, yes my recent flare has my rash back on some of my body and my face right now, however the Dead Sea Salt has seemed to settle down the Lupus skin flare up.I did use the Dead Sea Salt Soap on my face once in the shower and I have to say that it did leave my face squeaky clean to the touch and with a very light moisturized feeling. However my preferred, since my face is so very highly sensitive to fragrance, is to use it on my body. I really loved sudsing up my washcloth with this bar of soap, the resulting suds were small, soft and had a very gentle fragrance. After rinsing, just like on my face, the result was squeaky clean yet lightly moisturized.Now usually after using anything with Dead Sea Salts in it, I recommend rinsing well and then applying moisturizer&#8230; with this soap I recomend rinsing well and the moisturizer is your choice. The Dead Sea Salt Soap is made for Normal to Dry Skin  (and of course skin in between). For me? I rinsed well and the I still did moisturize, most of the time. When I didn&#8217;t moisturize my terribly dry skin on my legs showed dry flaking, so just when too worn out to bother moisturizing, I just hid those legs. lolThank you to Adovia Skin Care for allowing me to review their Dead Sea Salt Soap, I am so in love! Thank you again!

  AFTER: This Dead Sea Salt Soap form Adovia is a good entry way into the world of bar soap.  It&#8217;s made of natural (and easily pronounceable) ingredients:  palm and palm kernel oil, dead sea salts (magnesium, sodium, potassium, zinc), demineralized water, and natural extract fragrance.  I feel pretty good about putting this on my skin and my skin feels pretty good about it too.Compared to shower gel, it&#8217;s not as moisturizing, but for a bar soap, it&#8217;s not too drying.  It leaves me feeling very clean.  It also does a phenomenal job of getting rid of funk.  Seriously.  This is the soap to use after a workout or a long weekend camping.  I think it gets rid of stink better than most shower gels I&#8217;ve used.I am also in love with the fragrance of this soap.  It has a fresh, clean, laundry dried in the sun smell that I wish I could bottle and spray in my car.  Because it smells so good, I wish the smell lasted longer on my skin.  But I&#8217;ll take it making my bathroom smell nice and crisp after I shower.

  AFTER: I've been using it for 3 days and I already see a difference around my laugh line, basically it's gone. To be fair, I had the beginning stages of laugh lines and this combined with my normal skin care work wonderfully. It is important to note that I should have purchased the 0.5mm because the 1.0mm stings. I'm still getting used to the shock of the stinging sensation. Its stops immediately  after you're done passing the area in your face. Also, make sure that your skin care doesn't add on to the inflammation of your face. I used Apple Cider Vinegar as my skin toner and I make sure not to use it the same day as I use my micro needle roller. Please be aware that sunscreen is very important. I am a person of color and I use the sensitive Oil Of Olay sunscreen moisturizer. I have not broken out at all using it for the year and a half that I've used it.Again, this product is a great complimentary with your skin care line just make sure that you don't use products that is alcohol based or inflammatory skin care product the same day. You'll need a soothing product. If you use natural products I'd suggest a little grapeseed oil afterward on your skin.Oh most importantly, wash your face first and I forgot to mention DO NOT ADD PRESSURE as you roll the micro needle roller on your face. Just roll it on your face, for me I roll it twice around in one direction. You may try it differently but do not add pressure the needles are already doing their job.Hope this helps someone with sensitive skin.

  AFTER: This oil has a thickness and heaviness and a unique smell. I like to use it in conjunction with other oils to tone down the uniqueness of it's smell.  I like that consistancy that help other oils add moisture to the skin especially in winter weather and season.  Experiment with it and your favorite oils, you just might make a wonderful surprise.Just an update concerning this product; it works and penetrates areas where there is arthritis, you can feel the tingeling--not burning. The smell is easy to cover up so I want to give this additional info that can be so helpful to arthritis sufferers.

  AFTER: I have been using Clinique skincare for years. I use the 3-step, which gets a lot of haters, but it keeps my skin clear which is amazing since I'm prone to breakouts and reactions to stuff. I did notice that the DDML was just not enough moisture for me. I also wanted to start using something more anti-aging since I just turned 40. I was about to plunk down $60 on a Clinique moisturizer when my bestie and I were in Target. She swears by this cream, so in order to save some bucks I bought it. I am SO GLAD that I did! My face is more hydrated, more toned, it's tightened yet more hydrated than its been in ages. My redness and scars are evened out more already in just one week. I have not had any initial reaction or breakouts, if anything my clogged pores are less so. My large pores around my nose are smaller too. I dislike the fragrance, but for this sort of performance, I will put up with it. If they come out with a fragrance free version, I'll be a lifelong user. By the way, I don't care about sticking a finger in the jar, after all, I wash my hands, then my face, so it's clean fingers going in there anyway. I can't imagine that anyone would put dirty fingers in a jar of moisturizer, but ok...

  AFTER: This is a 4.4 ounce white bar of soap and comes in a neatly designed blue and white box.  It smells great.  But, it's a little on the perfumey side.  This is not a product for the men folk, unless he's walking on heals from a recent pedicure and has his head wrapped up in a floral towel.There are over 26 Dead Sea minerals contained in the bar.  Also present are zinc, bromide, sodium, calcium, magnesium and palm oil.  The soap can be used on a daily basis without drying out your moisture-challenged skin.We love it.  It's just what we needed!

  AFTER: I received a free product to review for my blog, and I am never disappointed by Adovia.I have been using this soap all over for a few weeks now, and I have nothing but good to say about it. It cleans without stripping natural oils, and it keeps me from being all stinky- hey in Arizona you have to watch that in summer;)I love the light scent of this product, and all of Adovia's products really.. it is fresh and clean smelling without being overwhelming or too girly. Just the right scent.I am still using their shampoo and conditioner, so it is a great complement for all 3 together.Thanks again to Adovia for a great product!

  AFTER: This thing is really the BEST mascara I've used.  The lashes look thicker and longer after use. The mascara adds a lot of volume and length to your lashes.The mascara doesn't smudge. If you get it on your upper eyelid, its very easy to remove;use a wet cotton swab and rub it off. It's also a very nice black. Although the little box doesn't look the same as the one shown in the picture. New design maybe? It doesn't make clumps and it's very smooth. I recommend this mascara. :)

  AFTER: ok, there is limited clumpiness, but I still found myself pulling out my handy dandy lash separating tool, which is fine, i don't mind the extra effort but I did not find any Wow factor with this mascara. Personally I think the LashBlast Volume (orange tube) is much more clump crushing, I NEVER have clumps or any lashes sticking together even after applying layer on top of layer, and it fans it out perfectly enough where I don't even need my separating tool. This one is ok, but when this runs out im sticking with last blast volume.

  AFTER: I received a low value free gift from the manufacturer for posting this review. I was not required or compelled to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with FTC 16 CFR, Part 255.I like that this Soap contains Dead Sea Salt and Minerals from the Dead Sea located in Israel. Both ingredients known to provide healing benefits to the human body.This soap come in a small box that well represents Adovia's design and standards. The Soap it self is a good size and it should last for some time.It has a nice scent, but it is very strong, and it made my allergies go a bit crazy. So I was not really able to use it on my face, but I have been using it for my body and do like how fresh and soft it leaves my skin.As much as I like Adovia Products, and while I did like the end results of the Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap, I think it's a bit on the high price, and I'm not sure that I would buy it because of my allergies. If on the other hand you enjoy or don't mind strong scents and are looking for a high quality soap that offers many benefits this may just be the soap for you.A fact that many may find appealing is that this soap can be freely used on the body and on a delicate face as well. Leaving the skin clean, refreshing and soft feeling.I wrote a more detailed review at our site, you are welcome to check it out at craftyspices {dot} com

I use the regular (not waterproof) and even through working out, it stays on and doesn't run.  (yes, I will wear mascara to work out if I go directly after work...) :-)  Great product.  Better than the CoverGirl in the orange tube.

  AFTER: I bought this out of curiosity without knowing what I am really purchasing .  And boy does this thing hurt when you roll it over your face!!!!  I would use it more often but it hurts too bad and it makes me sneeze continually.  It also punctured the skin on my nose to the point that it was bleeding.  I am sure it makes the product you put afterwards absorb faster because your skin is punctured.

  AFTER: I apply a few drops of the serum to my "trouble spots (around eyes, mouth - laugh lines, and forehead-in between brows)" every other day and I feel it makes a big difference in smoothing out fine lines. It seems like it helps with collagen boosting too. I feel like I'm just barely starting to discover signs of aging at 31 years old, and it may be my entire skin care routine that's helping. This stuff does sting a bit (especially if I use it after derma-rolling - OUCH!), and it smells like burnt nuts, but it is working for me. I've been using it for 2 1/2 months and I keep the little bottles in the fridge. I'll definitely re-order this when I'm out!

I still like it over some other brands I tried lately, but I started looking again because this cream seem to have a lot more silicon in it now. I usually use BB cream or foundation over it, now I could hardly get the cream absorbed enough even after 10 minutes. I really hope Olay would stick to the original formula! I'd give it a 5 star if there is not that much silicon.

  AFTER: This is a powerful dryer, but it doesn't singe my hair the way most do.  I'm used to a smaller dryer, so the heft took a little getting used to, but my small ones never felt like a salon dryer the way this one does.  My one caveat is if you have a specific storage space, be sure to pay attention to the measurements.  I didn't, but I lucked out.  It stays in a drawer in my vanity that has an electrical outlet built in, and it fits in there with no room to spare.  If it's even lying on a hairpin or its own cord, the drawer won't shut. So, I'm glad I bought it, and I expect we'll have a long and beautiful relationship.

  AFTER: Speaking as one of the 11% of Scotland (and their descendants) that has red hair, I'm convinced we have our own type of contact dermatitis.  I can't wear a lot of commercially produced eye makeup--only NYX Doll Eyes and this won't leave me with itchy, runny eyes.It's also very natural looking and goes well with auburn hair.  It doesn't flake off over the course of a long workday.  You can even nap in it, and it won't leave racoon eyes.I think it's my new favorite mascara.

  AFTER: It doesn't feel oily and it dries in under a minute! It's practically unscented and makes my skin  smooth, soft, and protected. This is the best affordable lotion I have ever found. However it says call poison control if ingested. wtf. The skin is an absorbent organ! Humans can die if their skin comes in contact with poision and absorbs it! So this warning label made me very wary because even if some harmful substance is only present in small amounts in this lotion, there's a chance that there will be build up in my body as I have been using this for years. I'm presently looking for a new body lotion. Any suggestions, fellow reviewers? please leave a comment.

  AFTER: Fell for the price and description of extreme lash lengthening, however in real life the mascara was on the dry side and it did not do much at all for my lashes.Perhaps I just got some old stock (who knows since they don't date these products - which they absolutely should do!) but name of this mascara is totally misleading, but for someone who wants a minimal and natural looking eyelash, this would be a good choice.

  AFTER: The heat and cool air is wonderful, I like the cold blast button. There's an indicator light for the ions working like they should. It's attractive in color and style, as far as blow dryers are concerned. It comes with a point attachment and a diffuser. It has three temperatures and the cold blast. The air flow is sufficient, and the heat is not too hot so it burns but hot enough it dries quickly. I've noticed a lot less frizz in my curly hair and my best friend borrowed it and she has super fine straight hair and had it blow dry smooth without any static when she borrowed it.If I had but one complaint, and it's really a minor one: the product 'feels' cheap. i worry a little bit that it's not going to be sturdy over the long haul if I drop it or knock it around.Other than that, I like how it looks, it's light enough it's easy to hold, and I like how it works. I'd definitely recommend it, but I also recommend treating it carefully, because it does look like it won't take a beating very well. if you travel a lot of are hard on appliances like this, you might want to find one a bit 'sturdier' feeling.But I think you'll be pleased with how it does your hair and it's worth the price.

  AFTER: I really like the IBD products because they are good quality, great price, and the bottles are much larger than their more expensive counterparts.But after using this basecoat, my daughter and I both discovered that the polish started peeling off after about 5 days.  My daughter used it first and I thought she just had "oily nails", but when I finally used it, the same thing happened.  The top coat and polish are okay because I'd used them many times; it's just the basecoat.

  AFTER: I have thick hair, so I need a hairdryer with some serious power and heat.  This model is much better than my last hairdryer.  It only has two heat settings, but that's all I really need.  I sometimes accidentally turn it off because of where the on/off switch is, but it takes 0.5 seconds to turn it back on so who cares.  It doesn't just blow air into my hair, it blows my hair around and gets it dry much faster than other hairdryers. It's light so my arm doesn't get tired.  I haven't had problems with it sucking my hair into the intake vent either.  I've had it for more than a year, and if it dies, I'll get another one.  Highly recommend!

  AFTER: I had previously been using CoverGirl Lash Exact for my first coat; then Maybelline Falsies for the second coat. It was kind of a pain using two different mascaras, but I liked features of both of them - the plastic brush of Lash Exact and the curve of Falsies. Then I found this one - plastic brush and curve all in one mascara. I also like that it's not a super skinny curved brush, but a little more substantial. I think Clump Crusher is kind of a stupid name, but this is fantastic for maximizing the length of my lashes.

  AFTER: This mascara is okay. As it claims, it adds volume and a little length without clumping. The biggest drawback, however, is that it starts flaking after a couple of hours, leaving a residue under my lower lashes. I usually use Covergirl's "professional" mascara, and although I don't think it provides quite as much volume as this one does, it doesn't flake or smear, no matter how long I wear it. Every other mascara I've tried does one or the other. This one didn't smear, but flaking was an issue.

When I received the product and open the package it was undamaged. I couldn't help but to smell it. The smell was amazing and not to over powering but does have a very clean smell to it. The soap is smooth and lathers perfectly. Its very moisturizing and natural with dead sea minerals. Left me feeling moisturized all day. It didn't even leave my face or body feeling dry. After the shower it has a lingering fragrance which is great. I love smelling good after a shower like you have just got out not like you only washed with water. Its not overpowering either but just very fresh. Loved it made my skin soft to the touch!!!!

  AFTER: I am 37 and starting to get those fine laugh lines and "crows feet".  I decided to give this a whirl.  While I like the unscented version better, the scented is still nice and not offensive; I have gotten creams in the past which are just too offensive and give me a headache.  My husband had commented on the earlier creams and for this one he hasn't said a word! (Not to mention the earlier ones did not work though I cannot remember, for the life of me, what they were; obviously I was not impressed.)The scented version has a light, non-offensive odor.  The unscented version has no odor (imagine that).  Regardless, they both do reduce fine lines!I was using it for about a week (8 days maybe?) before I saw a difference.  My fine lines were finer and less noticable.  (Probably no one but I noticed them before I started using this but it made me feel better and that is the point, isn't it?)And, when I got them, the exfoliating face-wash was being sold with it for half off.  And that is also a great product.I recommend this for anyone with light crease lines and who wants to keep their skin rejuvenated! I also highly recommend that you use the Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub Face Wash, as aforementioned.  I will also review that!

I tried "oil pulling" with this oil but it's just way too think and the smell and taste reminds me of motor oil.Apparently this oil has tons of benefits. There are some who take it orally but I just can't do it.  I use it on my skin for pimples, itch, rash and so on.  I use it as a face mask every couple days.  Basically just slap this on my face for about 15 minutes and rinse it off with cold water and facial soap.  And my skin is glowing.  And I'm a guy. LOL..Did some more research and it apparently removes "moles".  It's been about 3 days since I applied it on my moles and I really don't see any difference.  There is another method where you mix it with baking soda and apply it to the mole after to "scrape it", but I'll pass on that.  Not really sure about scratching my moles until it bleeds and then apply the oil and baking powder on it.For the price, this is one of the best investment I've made on skin care product.  I tried those other more expensive gimmicks that don't even come close to the results I get from this oil.Will update when my ugly moles starts falling off. That would be a freaking miracle.

  AFTER: I usually use all Gelish products but I loved this color and thought I would give it a try with my Gelish foundation and top it off...  so this morning I put this on my toes and OMG!!  The color is just amazing... the fine glittery shimmer that's in the color makes it have so much depth to it just being a very vibrant blue color..  can't wait to do a mani with this color this summer...  such a beautiful ocean water blue color...  LOVE IT!!!  and the product itself for a cheaper gel polish is really nice...  applies just as good as gelish..

  AFTER: This is the best hairdryer I've owned!I have long, very thick hair, so I usually only dry my bangs and air-dry the rest; drying and styling my whole head can take more than 30 minutes. This dryer has shortened my drying and styling time to under 10 minutes, fresh out of the shower. It's also lightweight, so my arm doesn't get tired holding it. One thing I wasn't expecting was how great my hair would look and feel afterward; usually, after drying, my hair is coarse and wavy and I have to take a flat iron to it. After using the ionic dryer, my hair is smooth and shiny; no need for the straightener!

  AFTER: I've had all kinds of skin treatments. Thermage, Fraxel, Cosmelon, Alpha Hydroxyl Acid Peels, even a couple of Jessner Peels and I used to use Retin-A. So far, this Needle Roller has been one of the most effective and least expensive things I've tried yet. I read up on it before purchasing and in some cases people have paid as much as $100 for one of these gadgets, so the price was really the main thing that attracted me. I chose the 1.00mm size as it was stated elsewhere that the larger 1.5mm and up will puncture the skin too deeply and cause bleeding. This size seems to be perfect. It abrades the skin enough so that serums (I use Skinbiology Copper with it) will penetrate and be more effective. The abrasion also triggers a "healing response" in the skin, so age spots, scars, etc. (which I consider to be a result of "incomplete healing") have a chance to further heal and diminish or go away entirely. I clean my roller after each use by squirting rubbing alcohol over it and drying off the excess with a blow dryer. It comes in a handy clear plastic case for storage that prevents the needles from touching anything so they remain clean and won't bend. You roll it on an area back and forth about 20 times each direction. Not the most pleasant sensation, it feels like a cactus rubbing on my skin. You can use a numbing cream with it, which I haven't tried yet--but I will. It causes a reddening similar to a sunburn that is usually gone by morning when I use it at night. Otherwise I am able to cover it with some concealer (I use either GloMinerals Camouflage or Eve Pearl Salmon Concealer). I noticed the very next day, after the 1st use, how much younger and better my skin looked. I've also been using it on the back of my hands and they are also looking younger as a result. I have a DPL and a Lightstim that I use twice a day (both) and I think that ALL of this combined, Derma Roller, Copper Serum, high quality cosmetics and LED red light therapy are a MUCH more effective and extremely affordable way to improve the appearance of my skin, especially in comparison to the $$$ I wasted at the dermatologist's office on the treatments I had (was talked into). And it's done in a slow, subtle way that is probably better in the long run for my skin.

  AFTER: Want long, voluminous, non-clumpy lashes? Look no further. This mascara is amazing! I have long lashes already. I wanted something that emphasizes that more and gives a lot of volume. This does exactly that. And the lashes are nicely separated and not clumped together making it look like I have 5 really thick eyelashes. The only thing I dislike is that it's quite difficult to get off, even with using an eyemakeup remover. It's quite a task at the end of the day to get it off completely because I put on many coats.

  AFTER: For years I had heard people talk about the benefits of castor oil but I was very content using my coconut oil. However, when my edges started thinning, I decided to try castor oil. I applied it to my edges almost every night before tying my hair up for the night and a month later it is thicker and longer. Be warned that this oil is thick and sticky (but I don't mind since it does the job).

  AFTER: Like another reviewer, I also have weird eyelashes, my right lashes curl down over my eye, but my left side is just fine.Every mascara I've tried in the past has just pulled the curl right out of my right lashes and down go my lashes over my eye, very annoying.I bought this based on the rave reviews, it shipped literally the next day so I tried it out, didn't expect much, but to my surprise my lashes held a curl! They didn't curl back down over my eye. My lashes on both sides also had length they never had before, but not fake stiff looking length. Also no flakes, no clumps and I didn't have to scrape it off at the end of the day, it came off like nothing with just a little eye make up remover.SO happy with this mascara, I finally found a winner.

  AFTER: I was wondering when I used this one if the salt in it would dry out my skin and leave a film.  When I used it I was very happy that it did not dry out my skin at all.  It left me feeling nice and clean.  It did not leave a filmy residue at all.  The smell is just a nice clean smell that reminded me a little of a spa.  I even used this bar of soap on my face and it left it feeling clean and even a little tighter.  It did not irritate my dry spots or my oily spots at all.  I have used it for about a week now and the bar of soap it just like new.  This soap is going to last me for quite awhile.  The mineral products are fantastic and they are at a fantastic price.

  AFTER: While somewhat moisturizing, it did nothing to firm my skin. I used it nightly, after washing my face, toning, then using the serum in the same line. After a month, there was no difference. I switched to organic sweet almond oil, and saw more results from it in just three days. I have just ordered frankincense essential oil, as well as an immortelle blend that I plan to add to the SAO. I've heard of much better results going this route than to keep using these supposed miracle creams. I gave it three stars only because it did provide some moisture and didn't break me out as much as some products have. The shipping time was adequate.

  AFTER: This bar soap is very moisturizing and lathers up really nicely. It's perfect for anyone with dry or normal/dry skin, since it hydrates so well. The bar itself is a nice thick size - bigger than most other bar soaps I have used - so it will last quite awhile. I'm usually not a fan of bar soaps since they tend to leave my skin dry, but this soap is as moisturizing and sudsy as a body wash cream. And the best part is that it contains natural ingredients from the earth.At first I was just using the soap on my body in the shower, until I realized I should be using it on my face too, as the directions state. I always get kind of nervous when trying new cleansers on my face and I've never tried a facial bar soap before, but man, this one really impressed me! I have sensitive skin and didn't have any irritation or redness, like I usually do after washing my face. I could feel all the dry skin being washed away, and it looks like it helped clear out my pores as well. This soap rinsed away easily and left my face feeling super clean and soft. I'm so excited to finally have a soap that doesn't leave my face red after using it! It's gentle and moisturizing, which is exactly what I need.

  AFTER: I have had the opportunity to try several products by Adovia and have liked them all.  Unfortunately this is the first product I do not care for due to the scent.  The fragrance is so strong that I had a reaction - sneezing and itching - as soon as I started using it. I was only able to use it the one time and had to remove it from our shower. However, if fragrances aren't a concern for you I would give it a try because out all the reviews I have read regarding this product only a few others have complained about the scent, and most people like the soap.  This soap is a healthier soap with less-toxic ingredients than the others you buy at the store, so it is worth a shot.  The company has a 100% 60 Day, money back guarantee, so you really have nothing to lose.  I will try this soap again when a fragrance-free version comes available.I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.

  AFTER: I've been obsessed with my DIY gel nail kit that I got for my birthday and have already accumulated five colors (two Sephora by OPI, one Sally Hansen, and two IBD). To be honest, I prefer the formulation of IBD the best. I find that I have to do three coats (as opposed to two coats with the OPI and Sally Hansen). In terms of removal, I'd say they're all pretty much the same...As for the color itself (Sparkling Embers), I'd say it's a pale rosy gold - almost like champagne! Although there's definitely glitter, the color is subtle enough for me to wear to work (and I work in a pretty conservative commercial real estate office). The thin formulation allows you to pick exactly how much color you want on your nails (rather than just glombing it on all at once).When I first purchased this product, the shipping calculation said seven business days, but it was actually delivered exactly a week after I ordered it. As a long time Prime member, I'm used to the (almost) instant gratification of two-day shipping, but this was definitely worth the wait!

After a short period of wear it began to flake off and my lash-line became irritated and itchy. This is when I decided it had to go, and I took it off.I've never had an allergic reaction to a mascara so I'm guessing it was due to this product and not an overall sensitivity. I have full lashes, maybe it would be better for somebody with thin lashes, I kinda doubt it though.For a product named clump crusher, and then produced clumps, I mean come on. 1 star. I can't think of a mascara I've liked less.

  AFTER: This product smells much better than the JBCO produced by other companies, is thick and rich and easy to use.As for it's ability to grow hair?  Here's my experience with the product.  I had a half dollar sized patch at the top front of my hair that had visibly thinned.  I believe it was due to the tremendous stress I was under at the time, but no matter the reason for it, it was there.  After reading some things said about this product in a Natural Hair forum on FB, I decided to give this a try.  I applied it morning and night with a Q tip to the effected area over the course of a month.  At the end of that time I parted my hair and noticed that the thinning was less than it had been, and called my daughter over to verify, and she saw it too.  I've not been as diligent in using it since then, but I have noticed that the hair has not thinned again, nor has it filled in any more than it had when I was using it.  I stopped using it as often and then not at all because since I wash my hair once a week, the area in which the product was applied took on a very oily feel, so while I may try using it again, I will likely limit the use to once per day.Hope that helps.

  AFTER: I used to love and swear by Aveeno but this winter the Aveeno lotion contributed to some sort of odd rash anywhere and everywhere I used the Aveeno. Each time I used the Aveeno the rash became worse and spread.. not good!While looking around for other lotions (this winter has been terribly dry!) I discovered the massage lotion that I prefer to use is actually less expensive per ounce than the Aveeno!  Once I realized my preferred massage lotion was actually less expensive and since I use these dispensers (Better Living Products Clear Choice Dispenser Three Chamber Shower Dispenser, White) for lotion anyway I realized I was better off purchasing the choice of professionals -Biotone Advanced Therapy Massage Lotion Gallon #ATL1G.  I now buy the massage lotion by the gallon to refill our lotion dispensers. The Biotone may SEEM more expensive but at the current prices it is in reality saving more than 40% per ounce AND is better on the environment since we are not discarding as many bottles over the lifetime of the product.

  AFTER: Review by Tom's wife.Love the smell & texture of this cream. However, I do not feel that it's hydrating enough for my dry skin. Maybe I should use it with the Regenerist serum. Strangely, I find the Olay Total Effects creams more hydrating.*Update: From 3 stars to 4 stars. I've been using this for approx. 2 weeks every evening now. Originally, I didn't think this cream was that great. I decided to leave my skin slightly damp before applying. I find this makes the product go on more smoothly. So, now my skin feels more hydrated. :)

  AFTER: I was a huge skeptic of this product when I first saw it and was drawn in by all the positive reviews. The roller was inexpensive, and if it wasn't going to work, I wouldn't be out a lot of money.I am 58 and the skin on my arms was starting to lose elasticity and had an "alligator/orange peel" kind of look to it.  I started using the roller on my lower arms.The first couple of times I used it, the upper layer of skin becomes slightly inflamed, inflamed the same way those "plumping" lipsticks work. I could feel that the skin was firmer, primarily because the skin had reacted to the needles by becoming slightly inflamed.  The skin is also sun-burn reddish for the day. After the swelling dies down; which for me was a full day later, you can clearly see that the skin really is firmer and the alligator/orange peel.  Out a week, and the alligator skin is gone.I am using the wheel on-and-off now for a couple of months. Do I think this works?  At first, you have to wait for the inflammation to die down, but then you are rewarded with a decade of wear taken off our skin. I haven't been brave enough to use this on my face.  I think that the 1.0MM is too rough for my face,  so I am going to buy a smaller needle for my face and use the 1.0MM on my arms

It was a lighter purple on my nails and was glittery too which you can't tell from the feature picture. It is a very pretty color.

  AFTER: I am on my three bottle I use this for my skin and hair this is one of the best products that will always stay with me forever.  I use to have bad skin acne I saw on you  tube some reviews about BCO once I brought it I been hook ever since.  It does exactly what it says my eyebrows were very thin by me plucking them constantly.  Every night I used BCO to my brows and within weeks my brows were so thick and full that amaze me.  Also with my hair when I did my big chop I started using it every night on my scalp even used it as a hot oil treatment and my hair has grown so much it's a amazing product.  Everyone I know that has use this product has given it rave reviews and I see why great product!

  AFTER: This is not the best Mascara ever.  Just so you know, the best is the basic mascara made by ColoreScience. It's perfect. You get long, long lashes, no clumping, the wand is so good you should never throw it away. Just clean it with rubbing alcohol every now and then and use it instead of whatever wand you find inside any other mascara you are using, which you shouldn't be. ColoreScience is the best. But boy, does this come close.I don't want too much "volume." How thick should your eyelash be before you start looking like Tammy Faye Baker.  We want length and color. If your lashes are so sparse you look like Minnie Mouse, buy artificial lashes or, even better, get them individually applied by a make up artist for special occasions. But don't clunk up your lashes so they look gummy. This gives the right amount of lengthening and thickening, even if you put it on with a heavy hand.CoverGirl Clump Crusher goes on easily. To challenge their "no clumping" claim, I slathered on four coats.  Two coats of mascara should be the limit. Three...you're pushing it. Four...get your diploma, you are a Clown College Graduate.  But even four layers didn't make my lashes stumpy or weird. They were starting to look overdone, so I stopped there. If you wait a few minutes and let the mascara dry, you can use your lash curler...even a heated one, without creating a mess. YOu get a little flaking and flecking, but not too bad. Still, it's always better to do the curling first. I like the brush, it has an interesting angle and the bristles sweep away a lot of excess product when you brush it on.  The curve follows the curve of the eye, so one stroke goes from one end of the lid to the other.  Straight brushes can be tricky because they reach only a portion of the lashes. When you go back to do the middle and other end, some lashes end up with too little, some too much mascara.By the way, I got a great tip from a make up artist:  If you use eyeliner on the inner eyelids, your eyes look smaller and harder.  Instead, use white or very light blue. It makes your eyes open up and look bigger and younger.  Use it on the inner lids top and bottom. Also nothing gets rid of eyebags (I don't mean temporary puffiness from staying up late or partying, but real undereye suitcases), so save your money for the surgery. BUT caffeine does temporarily provide a little bit of shrinkage. Soak cotton balls in cold coffee left from breakfast and place on the bags, lean back and relax for 20 minutes.  It should make a difference. I have also heard that Preparation H works, but I believe the formula has been changed.  Perhaps we should be checking out the hemmerhoid cream reviews!Thanks for your patience. I think this mascara is a good deal, easy to use whether you use make up often or only occasionally, and is fairly foolproof.

I'm a Gelish girl - but wanted to branch out to new colors and a different brand since Gelish hasn't really introduced any new colors I like.I used this color with Gelish Foundation Gel and Top It Off - and it worked perfectly.  It goes on similar to Gelish; I didn't really notice much difference.Gelish does have a color similar to this called &#34;Princess Tiara&#34;, BUT the IBD &#34;Smokey Plum&#34; is a little bit deeper and IMO a better fall color.

  AFTER: I have thick hair, so I need a hairdryer with some serious power and heat.  This model is much better than my last hairdryer.  It only has two heat settings, but that's all I really need.  I sometimes accidentally turn it off because of where the on/off switch is, but it takes 0.5 seconds to turn it back on so who cares.  It doesn't just blow air into my hair, it blows my hair around and gets it dry much faster than other hairdryers. It's light so my arm doesn't get tired.  I haven't had problems with it sucking my hair into the intake vent either.  I've had it for more than a year, and if it dies, I'll get another one.  Highly recommend!

  AFTER: This is a 4.4 ounce white bar of soap and comes in a neatly designed blue and white box.  It smells great.  But, it's a little on the perfumey side.  This is not a product for the men folk, unless he's walking on heals from a recent pedicure and has his head wrapped up in a floral towel.There are over 26 Dead Sea minerals contained in the bar.  Also present are zinc, bromide, sodium, calcium, magnesium and palm oil.  The soap can be used on a daily basis without drying out your moisture-challenged skin.We love it.  It's just what we needed!

It isn't waterproof for those who prefer waterproof mascara; it does come off very easily when washing your face. I actually like this better than a few of the higher priced brands, but must state that I don't wear contacts, so am not sure how it would work for those who do. It hasn't seemed to dry out my lashes (causing breakage) as some mascaras have. It's a basic, budget-friendly mascara that doesn't go on in globs and seems to hold up well throughout the day.

Also even without getting anything in your eye they sting a little just from the fumes, particularly when it is still drying, but slightly all day as well.As I said it works well as a body moisturizer but leaves my skin feeling a bit sticky.

It has tiny, tiny blue glitter that can only really be seen in very bright light, but adds a wonderful glimmer.I used three coats, though I probably would have been fine with two. It lasted for two weeks in almost perfect condition before I wanted to change to a new color. I mixed it with Gelish &#34;Foundation Base&#34; and &#34;Top It Off&#34; with no problems.It goes on very smooth. It was the first color I used for my DIY gel nails and I couldn't believe how perfect it looked and felt. IBD's color options and prices are fantastic. I haven't been disappointed yet.

  AFTER: Aging baby boomers, my wife and I don't get out as much as we once did, but we do still go out occasionally. My wife has always used very light makeup, but she still uses mascara to highlight her eyes and long lashes. When she developed a slight tremble in her hands a couple of years ago, she was concerned about applying mascara for fear of injuring her eyes, so I volunteered to apply it. Surprisingly, she accepted my offer. One of her biggest gripes about mascara is its tendency to clump and look messy, so she was glad to try Clump Crusher.The product comes in a sealed bottle with a separate brush that you can see through the packaging. The brush is slightly curved at the applicator end, which has dozens of very fine bristles about 1.5 mm long. The round brush's handle is about 0.9" in diameter, which makes it easy to hold. That's the obvious stuff.In use, we both appreciated how the fine bristles separated and coated her lashes evenly with no noticeable clumping. I applied one coat of the mascara to both her eyes around noon yesterday, then we left the house for about seven hours to deliver Christmas presents and have dinner at a restaurant. When we returned, we both examined her eyes and found no smudging or flaking, even with a few tears shed at one stop. Later that evening, my wife removed the mascara with a washcloth and warm soapy water. It removed fairly easily with no visible traces left.Overall, the Covergirl Clump Crusher Mascara appears to be a fine product that works as advertised. My wife is sold on the product.

  AFTER: I've tried every mascara on the planet over the past three decades (really!), and I've never been happier with anything as much as with this product. Other mascaras would either have a good brush, but a lousy formula - or vice versa - a great formula with a bad brush. Or, like Great Lash by Maybelline, it would lengthen but no volume. Or, like volumizing mascaras, you'd get volume, but no length. This mascara has it all in a perfect balance.  It builds your lashes quickly in one coat with just enough volume (no globs on lashes) and the most length of any "lengthening" mascara I've ever tried (no fibers that flake off in your eyes.)  The brush is perfect. Other volumizing mascaras have a fat brush that gets product on your skin.  This brush is fatter at the ends and thin in the middle, which places the right amount of mascara on your lashes without getting any on your skin.  And although it's not waterproof, this mascara has stayed on through tears and when I accidentally sprayed myself in the face with the garden hose.  I've even slept in it (I know, I know. Not good.), and it stayed put - the upper lashes anyway - with minimal flaking and no running.  The bottom lashes will flake off after 8 hours or so.  I'm almost afraid to like this mascara too much for fear the company will discontinue it. I'm tempted to stock up.  Highly recommended!

  AFTER: I needed a dryer just to keep at our cabin, so I wanted something cheaper that still worked well. I had decent luck with a Revlon dryer before so I went with this model. This is cheap, but does not work well at all. The power cord gets hotter than the dryer. It is surprisingly loud, even for a hair dryer. It takes at least 3 times the amount of time to dry my hair compared to my Rusk dryer, and twice as longer than an older Revlon dryer I have as a spare. Until a few days ago, I had almost waist length hair. I do understand that longer hair takes longer to dry, but this took 30 minutes and I gave up before completely dry. My arm hurt. What really chaps my pants is that I paid almost $30 for this at Ulta. Unfortunately, the exchange period closed before I got to the cabin to use this, so I am stuck with it. If I didn't cut my hair to shoulder length recently, I would probably just throw this away and spend the extra money on another Rusk.

  AFTER: Everyone's got a clump-free mascara these days, but most don't live up to their advertising.  This one actually does.  The well-designed brush has a curve that allows easy swiping of both upper and lower lashes without a single eye-poke.  That's key.  Many makers have tried brush shapes that, while they apply a lot of product, sometimes without clumps and sometimes with just a few small ones, there's either a poke factor or an angulation that's hard for even the most deft to achieve, let along arthritic older types like me.  This is easy, the product covers nicely with little effort, and there are no gyrations involved in application.  Until something better comes along, I'll call this the Best of Show.

I use Shiseido Future Solution LX Night Cream ($220) and this cream does not even come close to what it claims (as good as $500 creams), it can't even match Shiseido's which is 1/2 as expensive. Truly a let down, especially with the really strong scent for a cream. If this was a lotion, I would expect the scent to be strong, but for a facial cream, the scent is overpowering and feels like it belongs on the body, not on the face. It makes the cream feel very cheap and substandard.

  AFTER: I've always had a problem with mascara clumping. A trick I learned from a makeup artist is to very gently roll the wand in a tissue before applying; it works. This mascara is really good at NOT clumping right out of the bottle. However, it doesn't seem to build & lengthen my lashes as much as my L'Oreal Voluminous mascara. I needed to apply 2 coats to get my lashes thick looking (like the L'Oreal does in one coat) and after doing that, my lashes were mostly uncurled. I've always felt that the CoverGirl mascaras are too wet/thin. They tend to make my eyelashes "uncurl"/straighten out after curling & applying the mascara. This new formula is better than others but still uncurls.The positive part is this mascara did not clump even with 2 coats. But, my nicely curled lashes were no longer very curled. It does wear well; minimal flaking & no smudge after a long day. So I guess if you prefer minimal thickening/lengthening of your eyelashes, this would be a good product for you. I'm not sure I'll keep using it because I prefer a thicker looking lash but it is a good mascara & worth a try if you've had problems with clumping.

It isn't waterproof for those who prefer waterproof mascara; it does come off very easily when washing your face. I actually like this better than a few of the higher priced brands, but must state that I don't wear contacts, so am not sure how it would work for those who do. It hasn't seemed to dry out my lashes (causing breakage) as some mascaras have. It's a basic, budget-friendly mascara that doesn't go on in globs and seems to hold up well throughout the day.

  AFTER: Best body wash for moisturizing in the winter. Completely cured my itchy skin from the blasted heater. No heavy scent, the smell doesn't linger past toweling off. For some reason it's difficult to find in stores. Maybe everyone likes it! The price on Amazon is almost as good for the 2 pack as I can find in my area for one.

  AFTER: I received this product gratis, in exchange for a honest unbiased review.  I can say  with 5 stars, my skin loves this soap.  I love the texture, and how it fits perfectly in my hand. I barely drop the soap for it fits in my small hands just right, where regular bar soap feels awkward and super slippery.  This wonderful soap smells great and it is perfect for my dry skin.  I do not have to worry about showing off alligator legs when I use this soap.  I also love how the scent is fresh and clean, but not overpowering.

  AFTER: The soap smells amazing. Very fresh, very clean and not overpowering. It does not  get soggy in the shower after use. Something that I love because I really detest soaps that melt due to moisture and the mess it creates. This soap lathers a lot. Another thing I love. And it washes off easily and doesn't leave any residue so we know for sure impurities are being washed off. I have definitely seen an improvement with the acne on my skin. It has not fully disappeared but it has started clearing up. The redness is easing and those that did scare are lightening. The soap does not give me any extra moisture, so I still resort to my lotion application process of coconut oil and then my regular body lotion as normal.I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.

  AFTER: This is a good cream if you have sensitive or combination skin....or dry skin. if it is oily all over...it will be too heavy for you. not for teens or early twenties... its good for more mature skin and you will love how your skin will stay moist for a long period of time.....I use it all over my face even around my eyes and I normally can not do this with just any face product cause it will sting and burn my eyes.....not this one! I am  impressed!!! so if your looking for something that will help firm and minimize wrinkles and not harsh on the skin and easy to find ...this is it!!I gave it a 4 rating because I do not care for the heavy container and the lid...but product inside is really good!

  AFTER: While somewhat moisturizing, it did nothing to firm my skin. I used it nightly, after washing my face, toning, then using the serum in the same line. After a month, there was no difference. I switched to organic sweet almond oil, and saw more results from it in just three days. I have just ordered frankincense essential oil, as well as an immortelle blend that I plan to add to the SAO. I've heard of much better results going this route than to keep using these supposed miracle creams. I gave it three stars only because it did provide some moisture and didn't break me out as much as some products have. The shipping time was adequate.

  AFTER: The first time I tried the soap I was very surprised by it. When you open the box the bar comes in (even before) you get that wonderful soapy smell, one that brings back good memories for me. It's a fresh clean smell and I like that. Using it I was very happy with how well it lathered up and rinsed off. I didn't feel like I had that soap residue still on my skin. But I was still a little leery. I was sure my skin was going to feel dry and rough when I got done.Boy was I wrong!!After washing my face (and then I used it on my whole body) I felt great. My skin was not just clean, but it felt moisturized like I had used a moisturizing body wash. It was clean, fresh, smelled great and soft! My mind has been completely changed about using soap. Time and time again it has worked very well and feels great using.I really believe it is because of all the minerals from the Dead Sea that are in it as well as the palm oil it is made with. The combination makes the Dead Sea Salt Moisturizing Soap something that will gently clean and keep your skin feeling and looking great. I love this soap and think you will too!I received a sample of the product for review. All opinions expressed though are my own!!

  AFTER: I have been looking for a better mascara than I usually use (Maybelline Volum' Express Falsies). I gave this one a try and wasn't that impressed. It feels like hardly any mascara actually gets on your eye lashes so it looks very light.

  AFTER: So ive only used this twice in my life. It did hurt a little and left my face red on the first time but thats fine. Now after a month or so i tried it for a second time and thats when it scared me, besides the redning and pain on the sides a bit below my eyes it got swollen and felt a bit numb!I will try it again as it seems to be a wonderful product im just gonna have to order the smaller one for my more sensitive areas. I will be using this one on my butt to see if it finally gets rid of my tiger claw stretch marks lol*UPDATE 11/04/13Well this was def a piece of garbage on my facial skin. Ever since i rolled this crap on my face my skin has never been the same. My skin is still slowly recovering its scary! My face shows large pores and black dots which appears to be black heads throughout my face from my cheeks to my forehead to my chin :(It is really disappointing. Also it appears as if i have developed rosacea on my left cheek since there are two small spots looking pinkish purpleish and a bit swollen. This really makes me mad!! It has gotten better simply because i have been very persistent on my daily facial regimen care with natural products and scrubbing. This item will never again touch my face!! I havent even tried it on my butt for stretch marks like i said i would because im anxious it will get worst! If i ever develop the balls to try it there i will update whether for better or for worst, lets hope for the better if taken the chance!

  AFTER: I've tried 20 different formulations -- many different brands -- over the past 15 months and this one lasts longest, relieves dryness and itching as well as the rest (sorry for the AdSpeak), and isn't drastically overpriced. One main ingredient is colloidal oatmeal.Checking this product in the EWG Cosmetics database, the main ingredient of concern was Oxybenzone and I don't see that on the ingredient list (checking online, not on the bottle, which I can't read). Otherwise looks good.Standout feature is the duration of the effect.

  AFTER: I've spent my entire life looking for a mascara like this! I have thick, medium-length lashes, so I need a bit of a boost in the length department without insane, clumpy thickening. Every mascara I've tried that claims to define lashes without clumping has ended in one thing: clumping. I wind up having to go through my lashes with a metal eyelash comb in order to avoid looking like a drag queen. I've tried so, so, SO many mascaras (I can't even guess how many), from high-end lines to drugstore brands, with no real luck. But the second I put on this mascara, I realized it was time to dump every other tube in my collection. If they discontinue this line, I'll be heartbroken, because I already know this is my mascara holy grail.Update 4/24/13: I still love this mascara, but I have discovered that you can't sleep with it on. Whenever I do, I wake up with black smudges under my eyes. Yes, I know I shouldn't sleep in mascara--I'm not reducing my rating based on this, but merely pointing it out since I used to sleep inCoverGirl Lash Exact Mascara: Black Brown #910all the time with no problem. That being said, it's still my favorite mascara!!

  AFTER: First of all I must say that this oil is about the best thing you can put on your skin. I had known about castor oil's reputation as a laxative and hair growth aid, but I'm very skeptic with "miracle" products, even when they're natural. But I have to say that this oil really impressed me. I have been using different natural oils like coconut and olive oil infused with rosemary leaves on my hair with very good results, but 2 days ago I applied this oil to my scalp and hair and went to bed with a shower cap on. I washed my hair the next morning and I was amazed at the luxurious softness of my hair, with a healthy shine and with volume, not a single sign of greasiness whatsoever. Just soft, beautiful hair. It actually feels like baby hair. Another thing is that I noticed much less hair breakage and shedding when I combed my hair in the shower. Just a few strands, because my hair was so smooth it did not tangle much. My hair is relaxed, colored, thin and dry and breaks easy, but I'm sure this oil is going to help me keep it moisturized and with less breakage.It also works very well on the skin, although I've never used it on my face, except my eyelids, eyelashes and eyebrows. I apply it all over my body every night after a shower and I wake up with baby soft skin that is not greasy. The oil is thick and kind of sticky for a minute, but your skin will absorb it completely after a while and it won't feel greasy. It makes my skin feel more elastic and young, and I only get that feeling with expensive firming creams I cannot afford to use all over. It is not completely odorless, but the smell is very faint and kind of goes away after a few minutes and it's easily covered up with lotion or cologne. It's great for dry lips and tired looking eyes. I apply a tiny drop on my eyelids and the area where dark circles form and massage. The next morning my eyes look fresh and eyelids and nice and plump. My son has chronic eczema and this oil keeps his skin nicely moisturized and doesn't irritate his skin like most creams do. I also put some on my hands before doing the dishes and protects my hands. This oil is a godsend and I see myself using it for years to come. I wish I could give it 10 stars.

  AFTER: There are several key things that I look for when it comes to trying a new soap or body wash: scent, lather, how easily it washes off the skin, how my skin feels afterwards (including if my skin feels moisturized or dried out), if I can use it on my face/shave with it and how long the soap lasts. I wasted no time in putting this soap to the test.Scent- This soap smells AMAZING. The best way I can describe the scent is to say that it smells really &#34;clean&#34;. There is something else to the scent (faint floral notes?) but I can not place it. I thought the smell was a little overpowering when I first removed it from the box, but it isn't overpowering as you use it in the shower. It actually makes your entire bathroom smell amazing for hours after your shower. The scent also lingers a little on your skin (not a lot, but enough to be pleasant and make you feel clean).Lather- This soap not only lathers well, but it does so easily. You use very little of the soap when in the shower.How easily does it wash off the skin- Very easily. It does not stick to your skin or make you feel like you have to work to rinse it off.How does my skin feel after using- I feel really clean and smell amazing. The soap does not dry out my skin at all like most soaps do. My skin doesn't necessarily feel moist, but it doesn't feel dry or sore either. It feels soft, clean and healthy.Can I use it on my face/shave with it- Yes! If I use other bar soaps on my face it is peeling and dry when I get out of the shower. I have been using this Adovia Mineral Soap on my face for 2 weeks with no peeling or dryness. It makes my face feel so much cleaner than the facial wash I was using previously. I love it on my face! I have also not had as many breakouts. I have also been using this to shave. Since it lathers so well and is not drying, it makes shaving really easy.How long does the soap last- Well, I have been using this soap for about 2 weeks now. As of now the bar looks almost the original size. You can even still faintly see the Adovia stamp on the bar. It appears that this Adovia Mineral Soap will last for a long time.As you can see, the Adovia Dead Sea Salt Moisturizing Mineral Soap passed all of my tests with flying colors. The soap is currently on sale on Amazon for $11 with free shipping for everyone. I normally would not spend that much on a bar of soap, but this soap is definitely worth trying. I recommend it!

  AFTER: This truly does crush clumps. The wand is curved, with a thinner inner side, to lay down product, and a fatter outer edge that can comb and separate lashes, not that they needed it. I got the results that would normally require a lash comb.Unlike the other fat wand CG mascaras, I also didn't poke myself in the eye trying to reach the base of my lashes. No flaking all day and my lashes are as soft as if I were not wearing mascara. A great product, and I find other mascaras to be a compromise. Good stuff,!

I used to have those tiny bumps on the upper backs of my arms that drove me crazy but no more, not since I began using this lotion and the soap.  The price on Amazon is the best since I've seen it for up to $11.50 at the stores.  There is always an extra bottle under my cabinet.  Have also recommended it to many friends who swear by it as well once they began using it and enjoying the results.

After removing all makeup at night, I apply a bit to the lashes and lash line. I swear I see a difference - longer, thicker, and darker lashes. And it does not sting the eyes, or cause the slight skin discoloration that Latisse did.

  AFTER: I love this product for multiple reasons.  By background, I am an African American woman.  It really helps with hair growth as well as reducing shedding.  The only problem is that it's so thick, so I can only apply two days or so before I wash my hair.  Otherwise, it would weigh the hair down too much.  I also use it to moisturize my feet.  My feet are so soft and callus/shed free.  I would recommend this product to anyone.  I hear there are many uses and I just haven't implemented yet, but I will start using for other things as well.  Will definitely repurchase.

  AFTER: I really feel that this has helped me from getting wrinkles.  I am in my thirties and I have used this product for about three years.  If you like other Olay products (I love the Microgenerist), Olay sometimes has a rebate (a good one) for spending $50 on their products.  The only thing I don't like is that it has no sunscreen.

  AFTER: I have old stretch marks and loose skin from my pregnanacy and hoped to get rid of them with this and Palmer's oil with collagen, that I also bought on amazon.  I have noticed a little decrease in the appearance of the stretch marks, however the loose skin is still loose!  This is not too painful to use on my abs so I will continue to use it and hope to see results later.  I have been doing this for about a month 2-3 times per week.

  AFTER: Has a strong smell. The amount in the bottle couldn't really see if it did anything significant. I bought a bigger bottle of a different brand, and will see how that one goes. Also this one isn't cold pressed, which is the better way of extracting the oil.

  AFTER: I was wondering when I used this one if the salt in it would dry out my skin and leave a film.  When I used it I was very happy that it did not dry out my skin at all.  It left me feeling nice and clean.  It did not leave a filmy residue at all.  The smell is just a nice clean smell that reminded me a little of a spa.  I even used this bar of soap on my face and it left it feeling clean and even a little tighter.  It did not irritate my dry spots or my oily spots at all.  I have used it for about a week now and the bar of soap it just like new.  This soap is going to last me for quite awhile.  The mineral products are fantastic and they are at a fantastic price.

  AFTER: This is a 4.4 ounce white bar of soap and comes in a neatly designed blue and white box.  It smells great.  But, it's a little on the perfumey side.  This is not a product for the men folk, unless he's walking on heals from a recent pedicure and has his head wrapped up in a floral towel.There are over 26 Dead Sea minerals contained in the bar.  Also present are zinc, bromide, sodium, calcium, magnesium and palm oil.  The soap can be used on a daily basis without drying out your moisture-challenged skin.We love it.  It's just what we needed!

  AFTER: I use castor oil in conjunction with EVOO for the Oil Cleansing Method. Castor Oil is good for drawing out impurities in the skin, and when I felt a sebum plug in my hand, I was sold! I don't know if I plan to use it in my hair, but I definitely will continue to use it on my skin! It's a great oil, although it's very drying. This particular brand of Castor Oil is a great value, and 16 oz will last you a long time!

  AFTER: I've tried every mascara on the planet over the past three decades (really!), and I've never been happier with anything as much as with this product. Other mascaras would either have a good brush, but a lousy formula - or vice versa - a great formula with a bad brush. Or, like Great Lash by Maybelline, it would lengthen but no volume. Or, like volumizing mascaras, you'd get volume, but no length. This mascara has it all in a perfect balance.  It builds your lashes quickly in one coat with just enough volume (no globs on lashes) and the most length of any "lengthening" mascara I've ever tried (no fibers that flake off in your eyes.)  The brush is perfect. Other volumizing mascaras have a fat brush that gets product on your skin.  This brush is fatter at the ends and thin in the middle, which places the right amount of mascara on your lashes without getting any on your skin.  And although it's not waterproof, this mascara has stayed on through tears and when I accidentally sprayed myself in the face with the garden hose.  I've even slept in it (I know, I know. Not good.), and it stayed put - the upper lashes anyway - with minimal flaking and no running.  The bottom lashes will flake off after 8 hours or so.  I'm almost afraid to like this mascara too much for fear the company will discontinue it. I'm tempted to stock up.  Highly recommended!

  AFTER: I have been using this cream for over 2 years, it has virtually changed my life.  I was always suffering with dry and red skin in the winter and then oily skin in the summer.  Once I purchased this cream which happened to be in the winter, my sore red sensitive dry skin immediately felt saturated with moisture without any stinging or acne breakouts.  I immediately felt happy and relieved to have found a cream that worked so well.  I continued to use this cream for months and began noticing my skin was softer and smoother as well, I was so happy to stop stressing my skin out with products that irritated and stung my skin.  I thought when summer came I would have to switch creams but it turns out that this cream was fine for me in the summer as well.  I found that I only use it at night and in the morning I use the Olay with SPF in the day.  In the winter I use this cream both at night and in the morning over my SPF.  It truly works for me.  I am 46 and still occasionally get carded, no lie!  I also wanted to add that I have purchased generic versions of the microsculpting cream and once I read that the ingredients are the same I felt confident to try them, and all the generic versions I have tried work equally as good.  I believe it is the ingredients of course being identical to olays version.  I love this stuff!

  AFTER: Before purchasing JBCO I researched it for about a year.  WHY OH WHY did it take me so long to purchase?!!!!  This is a must have staple within your head to toe daily beauty regime!  It has a faint peanutty type of smell, but it's nothing that I can't deal with.  When I'm using this on my scalp and hair, whether it's before bed or styling for the day, once I use it, I spray my hair with Palmer's Olive Oil with Vitamin E hair spray because it has a nice clean smell that gives my hair that high gloss sheen all day long.  You will see results with this product so be patient.  Everyone's hair grows at a different pace.  It also depends on how much and how often you apply this product.  I also use it on my eyelashes and around my eyes for my night moisturizer, as well as for blemishes, dry cracked skin, cuts, burns, it is an all purpose beauty secret.  A little goes a long way.  BUY IT, USE IT AND SPREAD THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT IT ~ ENJOY!!!

  AFTER: I am a lover of Adovia products, so naturally this Dead Sea Salt Soap is no exception!The soap size is perfect for use on the face, or even in the shower. I like to use mine with a loofah and create a nice lather that way. I have sensitive skin, and I had no issues at all with this. I find that most Adovia products are mild enough and do not cause any irritation. As I mentioned above I use this in the shower on my body, but also as a facial soap as well. It leaves my skin feeling very soft, clean, hydrated and smooth. I like the fact that I can use this soap all over, makes for a better value.The smell is a fragrant clean sort of scent. I find that after I have used the soap, I will have a slight scent left lingering on my skin, which is nice. I can use my perfumes over it, and not have my perfume scent be mixed with my soap scent.I have had absolutely no issues with this soap at all, and it is something I give my recommendation on trying!Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.

  AFTER: I have thick hair, so I need a hairdryer with some serious power and heat.  This model is much better than my last hairdryer.  It only has two heat settings, but that's all I really need.  I sometimes accidentally turn it off because of where the on/off switch is, but it takes 0.5 seconds to turn it back on so who cares.  It doesn't just blow air into my hair, it blows my hair around and gets it dry much faster than other hairdryers. It's light so my arm doesn't get tired.  I haven't had problems with it sucking my hair into the intake vent either.  I've had it for more than a year, and if it dies, I'll get another one.  Highly recommend!

  AFTER: I actually really liked this hair dryer while it worked. It dried my hair relatively quickly. It also came with both a concentrating nozzle to make my hair straighten nicely and with a diffuser that worked really well at drying my hair on cold days that I wanted to leave it curly. While the dryer works, it works well.It started giving me trouble almost exactly one year after I purchased it, right when the warranty ends. It started by sparking once or twice as I was drying my hair. Then it began to stop blowing at random intervals until I tilted the hairdryer in different directions. It wasn't the plug - trying this at different outlets yielded the same result. This was annoying, but it seemed that if I pointed the dryer in a certain direction and didn't move, it would continue to blow. Then, finally, it got so bad that drying my hair was impossible - the blow dryer was stopping more than it was blowing. I expected it to last for longer than a year, so overall, the purchase was a disappointment.

  AFTER: I like this product combine with an anti wrinkle cream it works well or with the anti wrinkle patch. Ok, this product you must be careful with to much pressure on the eye area will hurt.  So roll lightly.  It is like a little meat tenderizer that allows the cream, lotions, serum etc., to penetrate theskin so you will get faster results.  I liked it but stopped using it after a week, so I only gave it three stars.  But now that i am writing this review i will start using it again tonight.  Happy rolling!

We were given the chance to try the soap. My wife loves it. This is what she says about this great soap.It has a light, but nice fragranceIt has a nice lather that makes her skin feel goodThere is no residue left on the skin like many of the store bought soaps. We also have a water softener which makes this soap last a long time.The soap makes her skin feel softer and healthierWe see an improvement in my daughter's skin.

I use a mix of Estee Lauder, Clinique, and SK-II skin care products plus this face cream, if I can only have one item, this is it.Can't remember exactly when and how I started using this cream, but I remember the day when I knew it was 'the one'. It was after one of my annual 12+ hours non-stop flights that normally made me look at least 5 years older thanks to the dry air and lack of sleep. During that flight I washed my face with just water then put on a good amount of this cream and repeated for another time. When I arrived at the destination and saw myself in a restroom mirror I couldn't believe my tired and blood-shot eyes that my face looked so smooth and fresh!It can feel a bit heavy for day time use, but not that bad when you carefully apply only a very thin layer. I've been using it as a night cream and cannot be happier with the result.

  AFTER: I have been using Clinique skincare for years. I use the 3-step, which gets a lot of haters, but it keeps my skin clear which is amazing since I'm prone to breakouts and reactions to stuff. I did notice that the DDML was just not enough moisture for me. I also wanted to start using something more anti-aging since I just turned 40. I was about to plunk down $60 on a Clinique moisturizer when my bestie and I were in Target. She swears by this cream, so in order to save some bucks I bought it. I am SO GLAD that I did! My face is more hydrated, more toned, it's tightened yet more hydrated than its been in ages. My redness and scars are evened out more already in just one week. I have not had any initial reaction or breakouts, if anything my clogged pores are less so. My large pores around my nose are smaller too. I dislike the fragrance, but for this sort of performance, I will put up with it. If they come out with a fragrance free version, I'll be a lifelong user. By the way, I don't care about sticking a finger in the jar, after all, I wash my hands, then my face, so it's clean fingers going in there anyway. I can't imagine that anyone would put dirty fingers in a jar of moisturizer, but ok...

  AFTER: I blow dry my hair just about every other day and I hadnt purchased a new hair dryer in about 7 years (even though I used it all the time, I cannot think of the brand- I tossed it and now just cannot remember).I bought this because I was looking for a hair dryer with a diffuser and high temperature settings, I have very long hair and was just thinking about cutting drying time.I love the attachments, The dryer gets really hot and I can get my hair dry in about 5-8 minutes, rather than the 15 it was taking me before. Great quality dryer, especially for the price.Looks nice as well.I am very happy with my new hair dryer!

  AFTER: I bought this to do french tips, in which if does wonderfully. It is a pure white color (whipped cream). It didnt go on super light, nor did it go on to thick, one coat is enough, but I used 2. Another plus is the bottle is MUCH bigger than I expected, its like twice the size of the gelish ones. Shipping was also very fast, will order again.

  AFTER: I have a T3 hairdryer that is similar to this one. If I had tried this revlon one 1st I would have never wasted my hard earned money on the T3! This hairdryer is fantastic!!! I bought it after my mother's finally kicked the bucket. She insisted I not get one as expensive as my own, but as I wanted to get her a similar one I read reviews about how this one was great and thought it was worth a shot. One of the best purchases of the year. Revlon really nailed it.

  AFTER: I've used Covergirl products for years.  I'm pleased with this mascara.  It really is a Clump Crusher!  There's nothing worse than clumps of mascara joining 2 or 3 lashes together.  The curved, plastic brush is easy to use and keeps lashes defined.  My eyes look great behind my glasses.  I recommend Covergirl Clump Crusher.It's not just for girls - I haven't been a girl for decades but still like to use natural looking eye makeup.  I think it's almost more important as I've gotten older so I don't look faded or cranky.Well done Covergirl.

  AFTER: This is the best hairdryer I've owned!I have long, very thick hair, so I usually only dry my bangs and air-dry the rest; drying and styling my whole head can take more than 30 minutes. This dryer has shortened my drying and styling time to under 10 minutes, fresh out of the shower. It's also lightweight, so my arm doesn't get tired holding it. One thing I wasn't expecting was how great my hair would look and feel afterward; usually, after drying, my hair is coarse and wavy and I have to take a flat iron to it. After using the ionic dryer, my hair is smooth and shiny; no need for the straightener!

  AFTER: Im using a mixture of almond oil, coconut oil, JBCO, argan oil, tea tree oil, peppermint oil for GHE every other night or so. Been natural for 5 years but used heat alot to damage my hair. There is a considerable difference in the thickness of my roots and its just a clear when flat ironed. Been trying to drink water and eat healthier too. So it would be all of the above. I even tried the inversion method for a couple days, maybe saw a 1/2' difference but braided my hair half way through the week. Will see what happens for the next 3 months but my hair is definitely thicker and has grown 4&#34; since May

  AFTER: I'm a fan of Cover Girl products because they work well and aren't overly expensive.  This mascara doesn't disappoint - it goes on smoothly with the brush and doesn't clump on my lashes.  I like that it colors and defines my lashes without thickening them too much, since I'm a little too old to pull off a dramatic super-huge-eyelash look.This mascara stays on all day without flaking or ending up smeared under my eyes, and it washes off easily with soap and water or cold cream.My only complaint is the odd shape of the container.  It's small on one end and top heavy so it wants to fall over, and angled at the other end so it can't stand on that end either.  And it's too fat in diameter to fit in the openings of my makeup case.  I do like the bright green color, since that makes it easy to find in a purse.

  AFTER: This is my favorite mascara of all time and, coming from a middle schooler obsessed with makeup, I've tried a looot of mascaras. If you are looking for length, this will give you length. Even if your lashes are short and stubby, this mascara will make your lashes look long and luscious. It doesn't do much for volume though so if you are looking to thicken your lashes this isn't that mascara for you. Although I would recommend the NYX doll eye volume waterproof mascara.

  AFTER: I give this 5 stars due to the things I consider extremely important in a gel polish.#1 is opacity. This polish took 2 coats to be opaque. That's wonderful!#2 is application. This polish applied wonderfully. Not streaky or too runny. Didn't pool in the cuticle area.#3 is shrink back. This polish has ZERO shrink back. As long as you cap the free edge as usual, there's no shrinking issues.#4 is price. You can't beat the price of IBD Just Gel polishes. They are all very reasonably priced.#5 is lasting power. This polish lasted 2 weeks and 4 days, zero chipping, cracking or peeling. Its looked flawless for the entire manicure.Black lava will now be my go to black gel Polish. Its simply black, no shimmer or frost. Its better than some of the expensive black gels I've tried and lasts way longer and applies better. Also the brush is in my opinion one of the best. Not too big, not too small. Doesn't make a mess of my cuticles :)

  AFTER: Very easy to use and is the perfect size for the face and hands.  Well spaced needles so that the needles penetrate properly and  doesn't scratch or drag across skin.  The needles are sharp and so far it's the most painless micro needle I've used so far.  This along with the derma stamp hopefully will be just what I need.** Please not that the great results after just one roll I learned were mainly due to micro-swelling. I've read that really good results come 3-6 months down the line.  However, I do like the micro-swelling because it lets me know that I'm rolling correctly and in the spots that I need.  The micro-swelling keeps the creases at bay and forces me to use other muscles in my face.  I would definitely do this a couple of days before an event I had to go to it's like a quick shot of botox that lasts about a week.**** UPDATE 04/26/13 I must advise those with areas of hyperpigmentation/melasma to NOT use on these areas too often.  I do have areas with hyperpigmentation, and I've found that it only darkened the area when used more than once in a couple of weeks.  I know that everyone's case of this is different, so my advice to you is to just use some caution and know that this might happen.  I also had some unusually bad stress during  this time, so it may have added to it.

  AFTER: The first thing I noticed about this soap was the incredible scent even before you open the package. most scented soaps have a nice smell once you take them out and sniff them with this one there is no need for that you can smell it without shoving it to you nose. The scent is not to strong though it is clean and fresh smelling. the scent stays on your skin in a light and clean way.This soap lathers nicely and is not gritty or sandy at all. this soap leaves you feeling fresh and clean and moisturized.

  AFTER: This is a good product. (Olay's new professional products line is really very good.) It lasted almost all winter (3 months) because it doesn't take much to cover the face. It did give a descent result - but not a dramatic result. If you are looking for a dramatic change in the surface of your skin it would be best to go with a prescription product. (They can only sell up to a certain strength without a prescription.) I don't like Retin A. I don't want too much skin to peel off, and I don't like they dry flaking it can cause. After selling many different skin care lines for many years and experimenting with others I've learned not to try to do too much of a dramatic change to the skin at once and peel a lot of layers off. Better slow than sorry. We only get one face. So, I don't want to peel my skin off eliminating too many layers at a time. It just seems dangerous to me, and I've seen some really frightening results. (I'm not a dermatologist, but when I've seen others try to peel many layers off at once it looks as if they will scar.) I also think micro-dermabrasion hurts, but that is just me. I've only done it one time.

  AFTER: I use castor oil in conjunction with EVOO for the Oil Cleansing Method. Castor Oil is good for drawing out impurities in the skin, and when I felt a sebum plug in my hand, I was sold! I don't know if I plan to use it in my hair, but I definitely will continue to use it on my skin! It's a great oil, although it's very drying. This particular brand of Castor Oil is a great value, and 16 oz will last you a long time!

  AFTER: Besides the horrendous smell, this is actually a great product.  I use it for my skin and I massage my gums with it.  (It's suppose to help fight gingivitis), but only time will tell.  I tried "oil pulling" with this oil but it's just way too think and the smell and taste reminds me of motor oil.Apparently this oil has tons of benefits. There are some who take it orally but I just can't do it.  I use it on my skin for pimples, itch, rash and so on.  I use it as a face mask every couple days.  Basically just slap this on my face for about 15 minutes and rinse it off with cold water and facial soap.  And my skin is glowing.  And I'm a guy. LOL..Did some more research and it apparently removes "moles".  It's been about 3 days since I applied it on my moles and I really don't see any difference.  There is another method where you mix it with baking soda and apply it to the mole after to "scrape it", but I'll pass on that.  Not really sure about scratching my moles until it bleeds and then apply the oil and baking powder on it.For the price, this is one of the best investment I've made on skin care product.  I tried those other more expensive gimmicks that don't even come close to the results I get from this oil.Will update when my ugly moles starts falling off. That would be a freaking miracle.

  AFTER: This is not the best Mascara ever.  Just so you know, the best is the basic mascara made by ColoreScience. It's perfect. You get long, long lashes, no clumping, the wand is so good you should never throw it away. Just clean it with rubbing alcohol every now and then and use it instead of whatever wand you find inside any other mascara you are using, which you shouldn't be. ColoreScience is the best. But boy, does this come close.I don't want too much "volume." How thick should your eyelash be before you start looking like Tammy Faye Baker.  We want length and color. If your lashes are so sparse you look like Minnie Mouse, buy artificial lashes or, even better, get them individually applied by a make up artist for special occasions. But don't clunk up your lashes so they look gummy. This gives the right amount of lengthening and thickening, even if you put it on with a heavy hand.CoverGirl Clump Crusher goes on easily. To challenge their "no clumping" claim, I slathered on four coats.  Two coats of mascara should be the limit. Three...you're pushing it. Four...get your diploma, you are a Clown College Graduate.  But even four layers didn't make my lashes stumpy or weird. They were starting to look overdone, so I stopped there. If you wait a few minutes and let the mascara dry, you can use your lash curler...even a heated one, without creating a mess. YOu get a little flaking and flecking, but not too bad. Still, it's always better to do the curling first. I like the brush, it has an interesting angle and the bristles sweep away a lot of excess product when you brush it on.  The curve follows the curve of the eye, so one stroke goes from one end of the lid to the other.  Straight brushes can be tricky because they reach only a portion of the lashes. When you go back to do the middle and other end, some lashes end up with too little, some too much mascara.By the way, I got a great tip from a make up artist:  If you use eyeliner on the inner eyelids, your eyes look smaller and harder.  Instead, use white or very light blue. It makes your eyes open up and look bigger and younger.  Use it on the inner lids top and bottom. Also nothing gets rid of eyebags (I don't mean temporary puffiness from staying up late or partying, but real undereye suitcases), so save your money for the surgery. BUT caffeine does temporarily provide a little bit of shrinkage. Soak cotton balls in cold coffee left from breakfast and place on the bags, lean back and relax for 20 minutes.  It should make a difference. I have also heard that Preparation H works, but I believe the formula has been changed.  Perhaps we should be checking out the hemmerhoid cream reviews!Thanks for your patience. I think this mascara is a good deal, easy to use whether you use make up often or only occasionally, and is fairly foolproof.

  AFTER: You must be crazy if you do not buy this product.  I have been using this product for about a week and I have to tell you my hair is longer and thicker and even healthier.  I usually use shea butter but because it is summer time I have to put the shea butter up until the winter.  OMG my hair is amazing and lovely.  Black Castrol works it works.  My edges are back and thick now and I have natural dark coloured jet black hair and it has help the shine in the hair. yes it is thick and the smell may not be to your liking but at the end of the day your hair will thank you bc hair needs natural ground earth products. ALSO you must eat healthy as well and exercise your hair needs that too. YOU MUST GET THIS.  You will not be disappointed. UPDATE!!! It is has been a year since I started using Black Castrol Oil and I STILL USE IT!!! What an awesome product!! My hair is extremely longer, thicker and healthier.

  AFTER: so first off, remember folks, the medical use for consumption of castor oil is for laxative effects! which it does quite effectively, considering other poster's commentary.  For beauty purposes, its a one size fits all miracle.  massage your scalp (try to avoid hair) for hairloss, or just general hair health and length encouragement, spread a bit on tips of hair for fly-away control and frizzie help. For calluses, massage in, cover with sock/glove and wait overnight, for acne scars, stretchmarks, pock-marks, scars and miscellaneous bumps and bruises, a bit of this applied helps clear most skin issues in relatively low timeframe.  I give it 4/5 stars because it has little smell, and a nice smell would be way nicer as well as an oil which is less viscous.  As it is, castor oil is relatively thick.If your wondering if this will 'work for you', then my experience says yes, since castor oil is so versatile!

  AFTER: I've tried many brands of mascara, both expensive and cheap, over the years. I just adore this stuff! It doesn't clump, flake, or smudge. It combs out perfectly and truly makes my lashes appear longer. I apply this after setting my makeup withSkindinavia Makeup Finishing Spray, 2 Ounce, so that I don't lose the curl after crimping. After putting a coat of this on for length, I then apply several coats ofCovergirl Lashblast Fusion Water Resistant Mascara Very Black 885, 0.44-Ounce. These two work beautifully together, and I've even been asked if I was wearing fake lashes. I believe the tools you use can make all the difference, so immediately after I've applied my mascara, I'll comb through my lashes withTweezerman Folding Lash Comb. My lashes turn out perfectly every time. *Note: if you do use this type of *needle* comb for your lashes, you must be extremely careful not to poke your eye out.

  AFTER: I have thick hair, so I need a hairdryer with some serious power and heat.  This model is much better than my last hairdryer.  It only has two heat settings, but that's all I really need.  I sometimes accidentally turn it off because of where the on/off switch is, but it takes 0.5 seconds to turn it back on so who cares.  It doesn't just blow air into my hair, it blows my hair around and gets it dry much faster than other hairdryers. It's light so my arm doesn't get tired.  I haven't had problems with it sucking my hair into the intake vent either.  I've had it for more than a year, and if it dies, I'll get another one.  Highly recommend!

  AFTER: I was given the opportunity to try this soap. I was hesitant because I DON'T like bar soap. I haven't used it in 15 years. But I can say I was pleasantly surprised with the feel of this soap on my face. There is good lather and a mild scent. Which is good because I don't like scented products on my face. It also did not dry out my skin which was wonderful. I can recommend this bar soap.

This is the smallest needled roller and it's quite uncomfortable, especially on my chest area, even when rolling very lightly.  If it does work, I'll have to come back to augment this review with a &#34;results&#34; message.  I'm going to have to build up a tolerance for it, which may take some time.

  AFTER: Decided to try it out due to the rave reviews on Reddit's /MakeupAddiction. It does not deserve the hype. I didn't like it at all.It gave me very stiff, clumpy lashes. After a short period of wear it began to flake off and my lash-line became irritated and itchy. This is when I decided it had to go, and I took it off.I've never had an allergic reaction to a mascara so I'm guessing it was due to this product and not an overall sensitivity. I have full lashes, maybe it would be better for somebody with thin lashes, I kinda doubt it though.For a product named clump crusher, and then produced clumps, I mean come on. 1 star. I can't think of a mascara I've liked less.

  AFTER: The following review is based on my wife's use of the product:I've been using this product for a couple weeks and love it. It goes on very smoothly and evenly with no clumps at all. My lashes are evenly coated and clearly separated every time. It stays on all day but comes off cleanly with my makeup remover. I was sent brown instead of my usual color black. I was impressed by the way the brown looked. Dark enough for my taste but still clearly brown. My only criticism is minor- the handle is wider than most other mascara's. It makes it feel a bit awkward in my small hand but ultimately I think it helps me apply the mascara better.

  AFTER: I have an expensive Ionic dryer that've use while at home. I was looking for an inexpensive dryer to take with me when I travel, and this is it. Not too big to pack, and it has all the qualities you need to dry your hair. It keeps the shine and dries my hair quickly.The Revlon 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ionic Lightweight Dryer features Tourmaline Ionic Technology for ultimate shine, volume, and healthier looking styles. This dryer has an ion indicator light, separate heat and speed switches, 2 heat/2 speed settings, cold shot button, hinged endcap, anti-skid bumpers, and concentrator and finger diffuser attachments. This ultra lightweight design is 25% lighter than my other dryer and has a sleek and upscale spray finish. This unit is super quiet and fast drying.Recommended. prisrob 05-03-14

  AFTER: I use this on my face for acne (which has really worked) as well as replacing my moisturizer and on my hair for softness (which has also worked.) I've been using on my face everyday for two weeks and my hair 1-2 times per week during that span. It looks like hardly any is missing from the bottle--so a little bit goes a LONG way! For the price offered here, you really can't go wrong. I imagine this will last at least 3-4 months.

  AFTER: For years I had heard people talk about the benefits of castor oil but I was very content using my coconut oil. However, when my edges started thinning, I decided to try castor oil. I applied it to my edges almost every night before tying my hair up for the night and a month later it is thicker and longer. Be warned that this oil is thick and sticky (but I don't mind since it does the job).

I have long, blonde eyelashes & this make them look even longer, curls them & makes them look thick all while separating them & really doesn't leave any clumps!!I absolutely recommend this mascara if you're not into the clumpy eyelash look. You can use 1 or 2 coats to make them look natural & 3-5 coats to make them look thicker & blacker. Love this mascara!! &#60;3I used to use the Maybelline falsies nascar which is terrible compared to this mascara. You will really love this wand&#8230;

  AFTER: I use a lot of natural oils, and castor oil is a regular player. Keep in mind it can be drying on its own so it needs to be mixed with a carrier oil-I use sweet almond oil and put a few drops of lavender oil in as well. It is a little thicker than some oils but once mixed it is fine. I can already see my over-plucked eyebrows growing back and plan on using it as a hair/scalp treatment as well. I noticed some have complained about the smell, but I have barely noticed it-sort of a light nutty smell. Just mix a few drops of essential oil in and you can have whatever scent you want. Lavender oil is also good for hair growth so I use that.

  AFTER: I've been using this mascara for about 2 weeks now and it works quite efficiently.  I don't have naturally thick lashes so this product does make them more noticeable.  I t lasts the entire day without getting gloppy; the brush has also stayed "unclumped," which makes forr easier application.  I really like the way the curved brush fits the curve of the eyelashes

  AFTER: Got it in the mail yesterday and put it to work last night. Reviewers who said it was painful were not joking. I have a high pain tolerance but man, that thing HURTS. I was really fighting back those tears! I also had to take mini-breaks.I tried not to add any pressure but then the wheel wouldn't spin and the needles ended up scratching my face. Imagine rubbing a cactus on your face. OUCH!! So I put just enough pressure to get the roller going and it kept squeaking big time. Did not sound good. I wished the roller was better lubricated so I wouldn't have to use ANY pressure. Then it wouldn't have been so bad. Maybe that's why some people are saying it didn't hurt?My face got red and warm,just like a sun-burn. I was kind of scared at first because I read (afterwards) that it can cause melasma and hyperpigmentation to darken. I was hoping to LIGHTEN melasma/hyperpigmentation, some very fine lines and very few acne scars. Next time I 'll go a lot easier on the pigmented areas and focus more on the lines and scars. Hopefully I can stir up enough courage to do this again in a couple of weeks.Woke up this morning and my face felt soft but dry and warm. It was still red and felt like a sun-burn. Put on all natural moisturizing/repair serums and sunscreen after my morning shower. Up close my face still looked painful but from a distance I had a really nice "sun-kissed glow." It was quite pretty. Like I was wearing a really pretty blush.Well that's all I can say about this roller for now. Hopefully once my face heels fully, I'll see and feel a little more improvement.

  AFTER: I got this product because I have been transitioning since Feb 2012 and I had a lot of breakage and shedding and I did not want to do the BIG CHOP, I did some research on U-tube and everyone swore by it, I have thin, chemically processed hair for 20 or more years, and I have to truly say that this product has thickening my hair in the crown areas where it was thining out. It is very thick, so I mix it with coconut, jojoba or avocado oils. I use it only once a week and I have seen wonderful results. I will be buying more of this product and will see what other ways I can use it.

  AFTER: Fell for the price and description of extreme lash lengthening, however in real life the mascara was on the dry side and it did not do much at all for my lashes.Perhaps I just got some old stock (who knows since they don't date these products - which they absolutely should do!) but name of this mascara is totally misleading, but for someone who wants a minimal and natural looking eyelash, this would be a good choice.

  AFTER: I love NYX, and I'm not surprised I love this mascara.  I normally use Clinique mascara, and when I say normally I mean everyday for the last 10 years.  I bought this because Clinique was out of my normal stuff.  I'm so glad I tried it because it's a great product.  It gives me length, and thickness.  It goes on smooth with no clumps, and the black is absolutely beautiful.  If you want a cheap mascara that wears like an expensive brand, I highly recommend this.  If you want something to just make your eyes POP and look amazing, then you definitely need to purchase this.

  AFTER: I am a mascara junkie so me rating this as my second favorite is a pretty big deal. First of all I love the bright green packaging totally cute. I have this in very black in water resistant. I love the shape of the wand because it makes it easy to get every eyelash on your eye. You can get the outer corner and the inner corner with ease. Also if you flip the brush upside down it is perfect for your bottom lashes. This mascara doesn't clump,smear,run, or anything bad. This is my go to mascara!

  AFTER: I read some great reviews for the Aveeno body wash and body lotion so I decided to try both of them. I use the Aveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Body Wash with Natural Oatmeal when I take my shower. It is like a cleanser that leaves my skin soft without the feeling of a film or an oil. After the shower, I follow up with this lotion.This lotion makes me feel moisturized. It blends into the skin quickly and easily and you can tell when the product has blended into your skin--you don't have to go on rubbing for ages. It doesn't really have much of a smell although sometimes I will get a whiff and it has kind of an odd scent but by the time you rub it in there really isn't a smell that I am aware of. This is great because if you wear perfume you don't have to worry about fragrances clashing. If you are like me and avoid perfumes, this is great because perfumey lotions make my nose itch and then I start sneezing.This lotion is not like any other lotion I have tried. It does not make me feel greasy like some lotions. The consistency does not feel watery so that while I am putting it on it feels like slightly thickened water and when I am done putting it on I know have to put on two more layers of lotion to get a decent layer of moisture on my skin. Unlike other lotions, my skin does not dry out and look dried out a few hours after putting it on. Unlike other lotions, this one is not overbearingly thick, requiring extra muscles to spread the lotion and rub it in.Basically, when you are done it feels like your skin, like you aren't wearing anything, like the way your skin is meant to feel rather than feeling like your skin is covered with layers of a moisturizing product.

  AFTER: WOW LOVE THIS HAIR DRYER. I called my stylist and asked her which is the best and gave her a couple choices.  She said Tourmaline Ionic Dryer. You can't beat this hair dryer and as one review from a stylist said she loves it and it is affordable vs. hundreds of $$$'s for the same thing that stylists use.  I use it with a Tourmaline Brush and I have curly hair which frizzes especially at the ends.  The tools it comes with like the finger styler and the round attachment for curly hair and a great dryer for this price is a great buy and I'm glad that it is affordable because not everyone can afford what they need. I'm grateful for the deal I got the day I purchased.  If I don't use my brush iron and wish to only use the dryer and my special brush then all I have to do is put a little pure argan oil on the ends and it smooths out the little friz on the ends.  Should I go curly the attachment is awesome. Helps to make the curls a nice style.  Shipping was on schedule and I'm a very happy customer. Almost forgot to add that you do get more shine as well. 100% happy.

  AFTER: For a long time, I have been using Lubiderm with SPF on my hands and chest.  I don't like to use my expensive skin products on these areas because the costs add up quickly.The problem with Lubriderm is that it contains fragrance.  I was hoping this Aveeno would be even more gentle and mild, since it doesn't contain perfume.  Not so.  For 3 days in a row, I wore this on my chest and hands and suffered horrible watery eyes and runny nose.  I'm not sure quite what to do.  I might just have to use face products on my chest and hands.  How frustrating.

  AFTER: This is not the best Mascara ever.  Just so you know, the best is the basic mascara made by ColoreScience. It's perfect. You get long, long lashes, no clumping, the wand is so good you should never throw it away. Just clean it with rubbing alcohol every now and then and use it instead of whatever wand you find inside any other mascara you are using, which you shouldn't be. ColoreScience is the best. But boy, does this come close.I don't want too much "volume." How thick should your eyelash be before you start looking like Tammy Faye Baker.  We want length and color. If your lashes are so sparse you look like Minnie Mouse, buy artificial lashes or, even better, get them individually applied by a make up artist for special occasions. But don't clunk up your lashes so they look gummy. This gives the right amount of lengthening and thickening, even if you put it on with a heavy hand.CoverGirl Clump Crusher goes on easily. To challenge their "no clumping" claim, I slathered on four coats.  Two coats of mascara should be the limit. Three...you're pushing it. Four...get your diploma, you are a Clown College Graduate.  But even four layers didn't make my lashes stumpy or weird. They were starting to look overdone, so I stopped there. If you wait a few minutes and let the mascara dry, you can use your lash curler...even a heated one, without creating a mess. YOu get a little flaking and flecking, but not too bad. Still, it's always better to do the curling first. I like the brush, it has an interesting angle and the bristles sweep away a lot of excess product when you brush it on.  The curve follows the curve of the eye, so one stroke goes from one end of the lid to the other.  Straight brushes can be tricky because they reach only a portion of the lashes. When you go back to do the middle and other end, some lashes end up with too little, some too much mascara.By the way, I got a great tip from a make up artist:  If you use eyeliner on the inner eyelids, your eyes look smaller and harder.  Instead, use white or very light blue. It makes your eyes open up and look bigger and younger.  Use it on the inner lids top and bottom. Also nothing gets rid of eyebags (I don't mean temporary puffiness from staying up late or partying, but real undereye suitcases), so save your money for the surgery. BUT caffeine does temporarily provide a little bit of shrinkage. Soak cotton balls in cold coffee left from breakfast and place on the bags, lean back and relax for 20 minutes.  It should make a difference. I have also heard that Preparation H works, but I believe the formula has been changed.  Perhaps we should be checking out the hemmerhoid cream reviews!Thanks for your patience. I think this mascara is a good deal, easy to use whether you use make up often or only occasionally, and is fairly foolproof.

  AFTER: I have tried just about everything- and I mean EVERYTHING (I worked in skincare for several years and was able to try hundreds of products for free)- and this is the one and only thing that 1) made any difference whatsoever on my pitted acne scarring (and a big difference at that)2) kept me from breaking out ONCE regardless of time of month or what I used on my face3) refined large pores and evened tone on my faceI couldn't believe how much it turned my skin around. I had redness, uneven tone, pitted scars and at least five or six blemishes at all times and after day two of using it, I had far less blemishes and less redness. By week two I had less scarring, smaller pores and no blemishes whatsoever. I have to say I've had NO issues with the quality of the product and I've used it every single day for two months. It still rolls just as well as it did the first time and it doesn't snag on skin at all. Works like new for me! The person who had problems with it probably just got a defective one, but neither of the two I've ordered have given me or my husband any problems.

I apply a lotion afterwards and my face is still a little red in the morning. I&#8217;ve noticed fewer scars in just a few weeks.

  AFTER: I've been using a Vidal Sassoon travel hair dryer for years and it was time to replace it.  I started looking at more expensive brands and was about to pay $139 on a light weight Sedu.  I asked my hairdresser for recommendations and she actually told me to save my money and buy a drug store brand.  After reading all of the reviews on Amazon, I settled on the Revlon RV544.  It's bigger than my travel hair dryer but it's about the same weight and it's a lot more powerful.  I've only used it a few times but I like it.  Unlike some reviewers, I don't find the buttons poorly placed and I think the cord is a good length.  Bottom line, you can't beat the Revlon RV544 for the price.UPDATE:  I've changed my mind about this blow dryer.  I have a lot of fine, layered hair. The blow dryer doesn't give my hair body.  I thought my hair was looking flat because I was in need of a hair cut.  Then I used a blow dryer at my gym and my hair looked fine.  I realized that it's not my hair, it's the dryer.NEW BOTTOM LINE:  Based on the positive reviews, I think this hair dryer is good for people with thick or curly or frizzy hair.  I can't recommend it for people with fine hair.

  AFTER: The consistency of the polish is great,  the brush is the right size,  and this color has just the right among of pigment.  You can easily see that the nails are polished,  but it isn't a loud Color. This color would be appropriate to wear anywhere. I love it!

  AFTER: This is the best mascara I have ever used in this price range.  I would recommend trying it!I'm so used to using mascara with huge brushes that make applying it more difficult that the little perfectly contoured brush that comes with this mascara was a real surprise.  It was perfect.  I don't know if my eyelashes have ever looked as long as they do with this mascara... And it adds above average volume too!

  AFTER: This thing is really the BEST mascara I've used.  The lashes look thicker and longer after use. The mascara adds a lot of volume and length to your lashes.The mascara doesn't smudge. If you get it on your upper eyelid, its very easy to remove;use a wet cotton swab and rub it off. It's also a very nice black. Although the little box doesn't look the same as the one shown in the picture. New design maybe? It doesn't make clumps and it's very smooth. I recommend this mascara. :)

  AFTER: Olay Micro-Sculpting Cream is collagenic -- that is, it can block your pores -- so users may experience milia, those hard little white dots/deposits under the skin, or acne.  When I first tried this product, I woke up the next morning with milia dotting my cheeks.  I immediately stopped using the cream.  A few weeks later, I decided to try it again.  This time, it took three days for my skin to react.  I figured then that perhaps my skin just needed to get used to it, so I waited a while before starting up again.  And I was right.  I'm able to use it now, although I'm very careful to use the cream only at night and another, noncollagenic moisturizer by day.  I'm still undecided if I will continue once I run out.  My skin feels great in the morning, but I remain wary.Since I use mainly unscented products, I was also surprised by the strength of the scent.  My husband can tell I applied the cream from across the room.  But if you tend to use scents, you probably won't find it overpowering.  Don't even bother trying this if you have adverse reactions to scents; it will be a waste of your money.I bought this product because I read that it provides the best results for the least amount of money.  Although that may be the case, the drawbacks are something to consider as well.  I recommend buying the smallest jar you can when first trying this and see whether your skin can handle it.  I was able to sensitize my own skin, but you may not be able to.  If you have oily or sensitive skin, beware.  Otherwise, it should make your skin feel smooth and supple.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann

  BEFORE: <none>
  AFTER: The product does exactly what it says... you'll get volume without your eyelashes clumping together, and the enjoy the added benefit that your mascara won't flake off or smudge during the day. It isn't waterproof for those who prefer waterproof mascara; it does come off very easily when washing your face. I actually like this better than a few of the higher priced brands, but must state that I don't wear contacts, so am not sure how it would work for those who do. It hasn't seemed to dry out my lashes (causing breakage) as some mascaras have. It's a basic, budget-friendly mascara that doesn't go on in globs and seems to hold up well throughout the day.

  AFTER: While I occasionally splurge on Buxom Lash mascara, my tried and true mascaras seem to be the newer series of Cover Girl ones that have come out in the last few years orAlmay One Coat Get Up and Grow Mascara, Black, 0.21-Ounce.  While some folks hate the large brush and tube of these newer ones, I don't mind them, and I love the new bristle brushes that coat without leaving clumps.  I've already had good luck using the regular Lash Blast (the one in the orange tube), but I thought I'd try this new one to see how it works.  I really like it, and it really does leave zero clumps!The curved brush on this also does a nice job of adding a gentle curl to your lashes. The non-waterproof formula stays put, even when my allergies are acting up and my eyes are teary.I bought this in the Very Black color, and it's still natural-looking.Like all Cover Girl mascaras, this also comes off easily, with just some eye makeup remover or face wash and water.  You don't have to tug or pull at your eyes.It's a keeper!

  AFTER: This mascara does as it describes.  There are no clumps no matter how many times you apply it.  Volume starts at about 3-4 strokes, the wand brush has many teeth to help seperate.

  AFTER: Heavy and moisturizing cream that is good to use at night time.I would not recommend using this before make up, at least for me, it is too heavy to use under make up.Also, the scent is way too strong.

  AFTER: I got this because I had to switch up a lot of my normal products when I became pregnant. I had heard this was safe for pregnancy and wrote Olay who assured me that all of their products are safe for pregnant women to use. The texture is nice and it does help moisturize and doesn't seem to break me out. Normally I prefer a retinol cream by Neutrogena but I can't use retinol products while pregnant. This has been a nice substitution. I will probably switch back once I am able but for now it was nice to find something that is safe to use, helps with my dry skin and is effective.

  AFTER: This stuff is awesome. and I now use it as my daily cleanser (on a loofa for exfoliation).  So mild, but I've noticed that it keeps my skin clearer than other cleansers I've used, without drying it out.  The bar lasts a long time - I've been using it daily for a month and its still got 90% left.  I've tried a few other Adovia products and am really loving everything I've had a chance to use from the line thus far.

  AFTER: This is my second favorite mascara after max factor 2000.  As the product says, you get no clumps, and I like the fact that it comes in brown shades.  While this lasts on your eyes longer than max factor, it's not as build-able, so you get less dramatic eyelashes.  If you are just looking for a little emphasis and no-fuss mascara (for work for example), but don't need super big lashes, this would be a good product for you.

  AFTER: I have been seeing this recommended on YouTube for hair growth for a pretty long time. I originally bought this about six months but only used it sparingly when I noticed my hair was dry. I never noticed the results everyone raved about so it took a backseat to my Dabur Vatika coconut oil. Recently, I have been doing my own hair (I was natural for 3 years and switched back to relaxers) which included amping up my regimen. I apply this black castor oil to my temples, outer edges, and ends of my hair. I lie to you not, just in the two weeks of me using it REGULARLY (I apply it every night and then wrap my hair) my hair is noticeably growing. My temples are extremely thin, partly hereditary and partly due to tension alopecia, and I have noticed parts that were bald and slick, now have fuzz and are filling out. Like I said, it's only been two weeks; imagine the results for YEARS! If your goal is hair growth I absolutely, positively, definitely recommend this for you.

  AFTER: This oil has helped me to grow and protect the edges of my hair. The bottle lasted over 4 months so far and is still going strong. It doesn't take a lot coat your hair because  it is so thick, think syrup, but not sticky at all. I would recommend to any people looking for healthy hair or a thick oil.

  AFTER: Well, if you say this roller doesn't hurt, you are kidding yourself. It does hurt, a lot too. However, this is when you apply pressure. But, if you keep it within the same area, the pain lessens. I was excited to receive this based on other reviews and my own personal research. I have since used the product about five times. At first, I used it a couple of times every other day, then I started waiting a week in between rolling. Your face does feel like you got a sunburn afterwards. Some people say it goes away within an hour, for me, it takes at least a day. After 24 hours, my skin looks plumped up. Although, it appears to get back to normal after three days (or two). I think it's working, but I can't be 100% sure. My skin seems to look better than it did when I first used it. I'm going to keep working with this. I have tried many other ways to boost collagen, so as long as I follow instructions, I don't see how it can hurt.

I definitely plan to continue using this product and I highly recommend it to others.

  AFTER: I think this may be one of those items that is brought in from China as not an authentic item.  On it's first use, I went to use the cold shot button and it stuck to that.  I changed all the settings hoping it would get reset, but for the day, it did not.  I turned it on the next day and it was working again.  Pretty poor for a brand new hair dryer.  Also, it gets extremely hot to where it can easily burn your head, even on its lowest setting.  Total piece of garbage.

I use the regular (not waterproof) and even through working out, it stays on and doesn't run.  (yes, I will wear mascara to work out if I go directly after work...) :-)  Great product.  Better than the CoverGirl in the orange tube.

  AFTER: I was losing my hair every day during the shower, while I comb my hair and so and so. I ordered this oil (delivery was very fast), the same day I received I put an small amount in my finger and give a 3 minutes massage in the scalp and I let it dry on my hair hours before I go to bed because this oil is very STICKY and smell very BAD, and I dIdn't want to leave stains on my pillow.  Same day I put some oil into my hair shampoo  and conditioner bottle.  So next morning I rinse my hair as usual I put shampoo and conditioner and I noticed there is no hair in the drain and nothing came off when I comb my hair.  Nothing else but no hair loss. NO MIRACLES.  Good for me, Not good for other people.  I will continue using this product and I will put my feedback in about 30 days to see if this oil is really working or not.

  AFTER: The first thing I noticed about this soap was the incredible scent even before you open the package. most scented soaps have a nice smell once you take them out and sniff them with this one there is no need for that you can smell it without shoving it to you nose. The scent is not to strong though it is clean and fresh smelling. the scent stays on your skin in a light and clean way.This soap lathers nicely and is not gritty or sandy at all. this soap leaves you feeling fresh and clean and moisturized.

  AFTER: Many soaps are drying and harsh for all over use. If you ever seen those commercials of the residue left behind, and those soaps could actually be ruining your skin than it's time for a change. Thanks to Adovia Mineral Skin Care for bringing us the  Moisturizing Mineral Soap with Dead Sea Salt and Minerals, that can be used all over and is great  for hydrating our skin and not drying it out!The Dead Sea is actually been known to do wonders for the body and now you may notice it in many products from hair care to skin care. The reason for using the Dead Sea is because the salts contain well over 21 minerals that are key to keeping our skin healthy. The Dead Sea Salts can benefit every skin issue and reverse the effects!Here is a list of many benefits of using a soap with Dead Sea Salts:Effective in cleaning and exfoliating the skin as compared to most soap products.Rids of toxins from the skin and helps in good blood circulation.Rid of dead skin cells, cleans skin pores and helps in skin regeneration.Firm up skin tissues and strengthens these against infections.Eliminate aches and body pains, making the body more relaxed.Treating skin ailments such as eczema and psoriasis and lessens inflammation of dry skin.Relieve muscle tension, lessens stress and anxiety.So when offered a bar of soap that cleans and feeds nutrients into the skin, than I'd buy it! Plus the price is great for something that can be used all over, face and body. It does have a lovely strong smell and soothing feel when applied to the skin. It looks like a regular soap bar, but acts almost like a lotion. It adds a smoothness on your skin, after your done showering. It feels great and can be used often!This is probably something that a dermatologist would recommend safe for those with eczema and other skin issues. For me, in the past I use to have horrible dry/eczema skin. It would be so itchy and I look like a crocodile( imagine an avocado skin), not pleasant!  However, once in awhile I still get very dry skin during the summer and this soap actually is moisturizing enough that if my dermatologist told me in the past that I should try using Dead Sea Salt Soap than maybe I wouldn't of had such dry skin!I think this is a wonderful product, great for the face and skin. I would recommend this to anyone who has skin issuesI can definitely tell you that my skin has improved a whole lot since I've used the Moisturizing Mineral Soap.

  AFTER: Got it in the mail yesterday and put it to work last night. Reviewers who said it was painful were not joking. I have a high pain tolerance but man, that thing HURTS. I was really fighting back those tears! I also had to take mini-breaks.I tried not to add any pressure but then the wheel wouldn't spin and the needles ended up scratching my face. Imagine rubbing a cactus on your face. OUCH!! So I put just enough pressure to get the roller going and it kept squeaking big time. Did not sound good. I wished the roller was better lubricated so I wouldn't have to use ANY pressure. Then it wouldn't have been so bad. Maybe that's why some people are saying it didn't hurt?My face got red and warm,just like a sun-burn. I was kind of scared at first because I read (afterwards) that it can cause melasma and hyperpigmentation to darken. I was hoping to LIGHTEN melasma/hyperpigmentation, some very fine lines and very few acne scars. Next time I 'll go a lot easier on the pigmented areas and focus more on the lines and scars. Hopefully I can stir up enough courage to do this again in a couple of weeks.Woke up this morning and my face felt soft but dry and warm. It was still red and felt like a sun-burn. Put on all natural moisturizing/repair serums and sunscreen after my morning shower. Up close my face still looked painful but from a distance I had a really nice "sun-kissed glow." It was quite pretty. Like I was wearing a really pretty blush.Well that's all I can say about this roller for now. Hopefully once my face heels fully, I'll see and feel a little more improvement.

I&#8217;ve got it in perfect condition (some people here were complaining about it being broken) and so far I&#8217;m happy with it.It&#8217;s painful on some areas more than others (or that&#8217;s just with me), but I guess it depends on pressure as well; pushing it more into skin means more pain, but I might as well since I want to see the full results and take the full advantage of the device. I apply a lotion afterwards and my face is still a little red in the morning. I&#8217;ve noticed fewer scars in just a few weeks. I&#8217;ll see how it goes with this one as far as pain and maybe in a future get the 1.5mm&#8230;.but not yet.

I simply added some of this Tropical Isle Living Jamaican Black Castor Oil (JBCO) to it and I like the results.  Our hair seems to be growing and we've experienced no adverse side effects to date.  Our scalps have not been itchy since applying the product and the stickiness isn't an issue because I added this to a homemade hair grease/pomade (at least 4 capfuls to about 14oz of hair cream.I'm not going to mention all the ingredients, but to give you an idea, my homemade hair creams and body salves are made of natural oils, such as virgin coconut oil, extra virgin olive oil, unrefined avocado oil, jojoba, a few nut oils, true ivory unrefined shea butter(softened by stirring with a fork, NOT MELTED!!), calendula essential oil, tea tree essential oil, myrrh, ylang ylang extra...you get the idea, all natural ingredients.  For the summer only, I added about 6 drops of vegetable glycerine to it to pull moisture out of the air and into our hair.  Don't do that in Winter because the air is dry from the heaters and furnaces being on and it will pull the moisture out of your scalp and the inside of your hair to moisturize the outside of your strand, which will quickly cause damage and breakage.  Vegetable glycerine is great for moisturizing during humid months.Also, I don't get what the big fuss is about the smell.  It doesn't smell good or bad to me and since it's mixed into a hair dressing when I apply it, I don't smell it afterward in my or my daughter's hair.I will say, that I also bought the same brand JBCO Hair food, which has a much more pungeant smell/odor than this oil.  I added some of this JBCO to it as well and applied that to our hair and scalp.  We still don't see what is offensive about the scent and I can barely if at all smell it once it's in our hair.  My suggestion, is that one could add a good essential oil to the bottle to tweak the smell.  I'd only put up to 6 drops though for such a small bottle.  Essential oils are powerful with wonderful benefits but could make you sick if not diluted well.  Always remember that essential oils can be diluted with oil only, so if you spill some or use it too concentrated on the skin or scalp, take coconut, olive, any vegetable or carrier oil will do to clean it off.  Water won't do any good because essential oils are oil soluble.  Wash it off with the vegetable/carrier oil, then wash that off with soap and water.  Another suggestion, is that this brand of JBCO is also sold in scented varieties.  The only one I've seen so far is Lavender.  It's supposedly slightly thinner in consistency, but people seem to like it and it smells good, so the reviews say (I haven't and don't plan on trying it, I'm satisfied with this original).If you're going to add essential oil to this JBCO, I recommend calendula, blood orange, lavender...something with a nice scent.  You could use fragrant oils manufactured exclusively for fragrancing cosmetics/soaps/candles and the like, but I wouldn't go that route unless you can find some made with plant oils and extracts instead of synthetic chemicals and no, I am not talking about body oils that you wear like perfume.  I guess you could but I personally would not.Anyway, I liked the way our homemade hair dressing and the Tropical Isle Living JBCO Hair Food worked before, but adding the JBCO to them seemed to increase the results of what we were looking for:  shine, manageability, softening, sealing and growth.This oil seems fine to me and I plan to buy much more of it.

  AFTER: Im using a mixture of almond oil, coconut oil, JBCO, argan oil, tea tree oil, peppermint oil for GHE every other night or so. Been natural for 5 years but used heat alot to damage my hair. There is a considerable difference in the thickness of my roots and its just a clear when flat ironed. Been trying to drink water and eat healthier too. So it would be all of the above. I even tried the inversion method for a couple days, maybe saw a 1/2' difference but braided my hair half way through the week. Will see what happens for the next 3 months but my hair is definitely thicker and has grown 4&#34; since May

  AFTER: My daughter and wife have very sensitive skin. Regular soaps irritate their skin and make them break out. We have a water softener that helps, but we needed more help. We were given the chance to try the soap. My wife loves it. This is what she says about this great soap.It has a light, but nice fragranceIt has a nice lather that makes her skin feel goodThere is no residue left on the skin like many of the store bought soaps. We also have a water softener which makes this soap last a long time.The soap makes her skin feel softer and healthierWe see an improvement in my daughter's skin. Especially on her legs that get dried and itchy from other soaps.The price is a little expensive, but the soap does the trick and we got to try it for freeWould recommend this soap much more than regular bars of soap

  AFTER: Very easy to use and is the perfect size for the face and hands.  Well spaced needles so that the needles penetrate properly and  doesn't scratch or drag across skin.  The needles are sharp and so far it's the most painless micro needle I've used so far.  This along with the derma stamp hopefully will be just what I need.** Please not that the great results after just one roll I learned were mainly due to micro-swelling. I've read that really good results come 3-6 months down the line.  However, I do like the micro-swelling because it lets me know that I'm rolling correctly and in the spots that I need.  The micro-swelling keeps the creases at bay and forces me to use other muscles in my face.  I would definitely do this a couple of days before an event I had to go to it's like a quick shot of botox that lasts about a week.**** UPDATE 04/26/13 I must advise those with areas of hyperpigmentation/melasma to NOT use on these areas too often.  I do have areas with hyperpigmentation, and I've found that it only darkened the area when used more than once in a couple of weeks.  I know that everyone's case of this is different, so my advice to you is to just use some caution and know that this might happen.  I also had some unusually bad stress during  this time, so it may have added to it.

  AFTER: This is one of the nicest all natural soaps I&#8217;ve come across. Its first two ingredients are natural oils known for their moisturizing properties and does not contain any actual soap. No harsh chemicals to counteract the good and no extra fillers to cheapen the product.As I already mentioned, my skin tends to be very dry and itchy and it wasn&#8217;t until I began using Adovia Natural Dead Sea Mud Soap that I finally had an epiphany about the ingredients in soap. This soap, the moisturizing soap, doesn&#8217;t have loads of lather either because all of its ingredients are natural. No sodium lauryl sulfate! Sodium lauryl sulfate is the ingredient in soaps, shampoos and household cleansers (!) that cause them to lather up, and its dangers are well known.* I&#8217;m extraordinarily sensitive to sodium lauryl sulfate in oral care products. It makes my tongue and gums burn so badly that before I was clued in by a doctor I could only eat or drink items that were at room temperature. I was in misery. Why did it take so long for me to realize that it could be affecting my skin? I love Adovia&#8217;s mud soap for my body but this moisturizing formula is perfect for the more sensitive skin of my face.Adovia Moisturizing Dead Sea Salt Soap has a lovely light scent that doesn&#8217;t linger and that&#8217;s another huge bonus in my book. My skin feels clean, not tight, moisturized, not greasy, and soft not rough and uneven. I follow up with Adovia Dead Sea Salt Facial Serum and love the way my skin feels these days.

  AFTER: Upon opening the box to try this soap (mind you I was skeptikal about using a bar soap on my face), it looked raw and although it was smooth to touch it still didn't look like a regular bar of soap. The smell was invigorating and it captured my attention as soon as I started washing my face. This soap does not lather much so do not expect it to. Too much lather strips skin from moisture whereas this soap infuses your face with moisture and hydration. The process is rather simple to use, wet face/body, wet soap, apply to face and rinse. Your face/body feels soft and smooth to touch. When rinsing the soap off your face/body it does not leave a oily or sticky residue behind.With all the benefits the dead sea has to offer and the fact that there are no additional chemicals, it is a go to product. Although it is pricey for a soap, since it does not lather much it will last long.

  AFTER: I purchased this item to replace an ancient, 1980's-era blow dryer, and based my choice on its excellent reviews. I have to agree, this is an excellent product. I first noticed that even on the highest setting the dryer did not get as hot as my old one. I thought this might be a problem, but actually it is an advantage as it won't burn you if you leave it in one place too long. The volume of air being pushed out of this dryer is far stronger than my old hair dryer, so it dries very fast. I have naturally wavy hair that tends to frizz and I used the dryer to straighten it. Much to my surprise, this dryer not only dried my hair very quickly, it left it very smooth with no frizz. It must be the lower heat with the strong blast of air that works so well. Whatever it is, I highly recommend it!

This soap will lather up really well and rinses off clean and leaving your skin smelling fresh and smooth like a baby.This soap will leave your skin feeling soft and hydrated. And I should know because I have really dry skin and am always looking for the best product to get my skin back in shape without having to spend a fortune. I have seen several comments that say it works really good on eczema, so if you have that skin condition, give it a try and see if it helps you.

But I can say I was pleasantly surprised with the feel of this soap on my face. There is good lather and a mild scent. Which is good because I don't like scented products on my face. It also did not dry out my skin which was wonderful. I can recommend this bar soap.

The only negative is the ingredients ( I wish stuff that worked wasn't loaded with chemicals) and the scent. It's very strong.Now, about the age defying properties, I don't think it actually does anything for the skin except moisturize and keep the complexion looking nice. I have few wrinkles but the lines on my forehead seem to remain despite using this product for a year consecutively. So, great moisturizer- that's it.

  AFTER: OMG! I love this Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap! When I first heard this product, I thought the soap was going to be rough or grainy because of the &#34;Dead Sea Salt&#34; but, I was so wrong. When I opened the box for the first time, the scent was strong, but I liked the scent. It's a very clean, fresh, almost kind of an ivory scent. I put it in my shower and left and when I returned the whole bathroom smelled so nice. And, even after I use it in the shower, there is still a nice lingering fragrance on my skin after each use. It lathers very well and rinses off without leaving any residue. My skin feels so soft and smooth afterward, especially my face! Some soaps leave your face dry, this one leaves my face feeling fresh, clean and moisturized... This bar of soap is amazing and it feels great! I'm going to continue to use this product and recommend it to everyone!Disclosure: I was not financially compensated for this post.

  AFTER: i haven't used any needle roller before and I did try it once, I don't think I even punctured my skin, I was barely touching it on my face and it was a little too much for me, but I am a sissy with pain. So I ordered the 0.5mm size and that one I can tolerate and do properly. Just remember to clean face and hands good, always use clean/disinfected roller. I just used the bleach and water solution and soak it for 10 mins, but just bought some alcohol and will be using the alcohol to disinfect it a little.When rolling, roll in one direction, someone recommended to just roll once direction, then lift and roll again. I did try that roll once, but now I get the hang of it, I can roll on the same area without moving the roller to much, repeat 8-10 tiems. When you move the roller while rolling it can potentially cut your face so please be careful. You will notice your face turning red and some areas where its not too red, then I just go over that area with a roller again. I had been doing this for 2 weeks now so haven't really noticed a significant change. But I can tell that when I applied the Hyaluronic with C & E, it really gets soaked up right away and my skin is softer. Also I was doing the peel and had noticed some chages on my pores, getting smaller, yeeey! So I really dont know whats working, but Im sure its the combination of Peel, Roller and Hyaluronic acid.

  AFTER: This is GREAT mascara, it is just as described. It gives you Doll Eyes if you put on multiple coats waiting 30 seconds in between each layer for them to dry.

  AFTER: This is not the best Mascara ever.  Just so you know, the best is the basic mascara made by ColoreScience. It's perfect. You get long, long lashes, no clumping, the wand is so good you should never throw it away. Just clean it with rubbing alcohol every now and then and use it instead of whatever wand you find inside any other mascara you are using, which you shouldn't be. ColoreScience is the best. But boy, does this come close.I don't want too much "volume." How thick should your eyelash be before you start looking like Tammy Faye Baker.  We want length and color. If your lashes are so sparse you look like Minnie Mouse, buy artificial lashes or, even better, get them individually applied by a make up artist for special occasions. But don't clunk up your lashes so they look gummy. This gives the right amount of lengthening and thickening, even if you put it on with a heavy hand.CoverGirl Clump Crusher goes on easily. To challenge their "no clumping" claim, I slathered on four coats.  Two coats of mascara should be the limit. Three...you're pushing it. Four...get your diploma, you are a Clown College Graduate.  But even four layers didn't make my lashes stumpy or weird. They were starting to look overdone, so I stopped there. If you wait a few minutes and let the mascara dry, you can use your lash curler...even a heated one, without creating a mess. YOu get a little flaking and flecking, but not too bad. Still, it's always better to do the curling first. I like the brush, it has an interesting angle and the bristles sweep away a lot of excess product when you brush it on.  The curve follows the curve of the eye, so one stroke goes from one end of the lid to the other.  Straight brushes can be tricky because they reach only a portion of the lashes. When you go back to do the middle and other end, some lashes end up with too little, some too much mascara.By the way, I got a great tip from a make up artist:  If you use eyeliner on the inner eyelids, your eyes look smaller and harder.  Instead, use white or very light blue. It makes your eyes open up and look bigger and younger.  Use it on the inner lids top and bottom. Also nothing gets rid of eyebags (I don't mean temporary puffiness from staying up late or partying, but real undereye suitcases), so save your money for the surgery. BUT caffeine does temporarily provide a little bit of shrinkage. Soak cotton balls in cold coffee left from breakfast and place on the bags, lean back and relax for 20 minutes.  It should make a difference. I have also heard that Preparation H works, but I believe the formula has been changed.  Perhaps we should be checking out the hemmerhoid cream reviews!Thanks for your patience. I think this mascara is a good deal, easy to use whether you use make up often or only occasionally, and is fairly foolproof.

  AFTER: Aging baby boomers, my wife and I don't get out as much as we once did, but we do still go out occasionally. My wife has always used very light makeup, but she still uses mascara to highlight her eyes and long lashes. When she developed a slight tremble in her hands a couple of years ago, she was concerned about applying mascara for fear of injuring her eyes, so I volunteered to apply it. Surprisingly, she accepted my offer. One of her biggest gripes about mascara is its tendency to clump and look messy, so she was glad to try Clump Crusher.The product comes in a sealed bottle with a separate brush that you can see through the packaging. The brush is slightly curved at the applicator end, which has dozens of very fine bristles about 1.5 mm long. The round brush's handle is about 0.9" in diameter, which makes it easy to hold. That's the obvious stuff.In use, we both appreciated how the fine bristles separated and coated her lashes evenly with no noticeable clumping. I applied one coat of the mascara to both her eyes around noon yesterday, then we left the house for about seven hours to deliver Christmas presents and have dinner at a restaurant. When we returned, we both examined her eyes and found no smudging or flaking, even with a few tears shed at one stop. Later that evening, my wife removed the mascara with a washcloth and warm soapy water. It removed fairly easily with no visible traces left.Overall, the Covergirl Clump Crusher Mascara appears to be a fine product that works as advertised. My wife is sold on the product.

  AFTER: My review is on the whole experience of the product and SellerShippingShipping was fast, was delivered before the system could even catch up ..next day ! Great shipping. It arrived packaged perfectly.ProductThis product at first to me was a dud. I wanted to seal my polish ( Non UV Polish) which I do with my other UV coats. This product DOES NOT work with regular nail polish :(. Then I tried it on my overlay and it was tacky, much more tacky than other brands.It dries at a normal paceThe shine is a great luster shineSuggestions:Remember to use rubbing alcohol once you set the UV coat to remove the excess product build up and to remove the tackiness. Apply a really, really thin layer to get the best results.If you are looking a for a Top coat for your solar nails, natural nails and or overlays without polish this is a great product.If you are looking for a Top coat that will seal and secure ANY Polish..try Gelish or Seche brands.

  AFTER: I  rolled with it on my face yesterday and it was painful, but tolerable. I woke up this morning seeing a little improvement. I will use this twice a week and then once a month. I was going to try the chemical peeling, but glad I've decided to try this and if it fails me, I will then try the chemical peeling. The laser treatment is my last resort, so I need to save up in the future just in case.Update: Today was my 3rd time using this. My face do become red which is a good thing 'cause it means that I did it correctly..My few months old red marks faded! But not completely. I see improvement on acne scars. This thing is amazing and you should get it even if you don't have scars! Your skin will be smooth and you'll look younger.UPDATE #2: I've been doing the roller everyday, but I am only doing this for two weeks then I will start rolling my skin once a  week, then once a months. It does hurt a lot, but I don't care, I just do it. My skin turns red afterward which last a few hours. I don't have any active pimples and my dark spots on scars faded almost completely. I do see a small improvement on scars. I got a haircut which reveals most of my scarring and I didn't receive any comments about how awful my scars are.. instead, they said I look clean and that my skin is pale. They also said I look better.. but I don't think so.. I have more scars showing. I ordered the chemical peel to apply just on problem area.

  AFTER: I have fallen in love with a different brand of body soaps that are paraben free.  Before, I was a loyal fan of Aveeno.  Nothing wrong with the product, just that it has parabens (nothing toxic), but not as natural as some of the other soaps that I have discovered.  I love the scent, and how it feels on the skin after each use.  It a great product, but I have found betters ones recently.

  AFTER: I bought this as one component of a shave oil I made for my boyfriend, but now I use it on my skin when it needs a little extra moisture. It seems to absorb well and be pretty much odorless. The price here is much better than the brick and mortar stores in my area, too.

  AFTER: I was recently asked to try Adovia's Dead Sea Salt Soap in exchange for my unbiased opinion.  I personally don't care for bar soap because they leave that waxy feel on your skin, but I love all of the other Dead Sea products from Adovia so I wanted to give it a try.As soon as I opened the box, it had a fresh light scent that was very pleasing.The later is very rich and washes off completely.There was no residue at all!!!My Skin was so soft and it smelled fresh all day.I also noticed that the bar of soap doesn't get that slimy feel when it gets wet like other bar soaps do.Overall I loved everything about the soap, I noticed some say the price was a bit high, but this bar will outlast a bottle of body wash for sure.  I think it is very comparable in price, considering the quality is amazing.My son has eczema, and I had him try the soap and it was so gentle on his skin.  This is great for all skin types.

  AFTER: My face felt a little red and irritated for the first week I used this. I even had a couple of minor breakouts.I stuck with it, like I read on a beauty website, and I'm happy I did.My face is smoother. The sensitivity is gone and I'm not experiencing any more breakouts.I think my skin had to cycle through and turnover old cells (and purge itself of oil and debris)Once that was done, it looks great. Honestly one of the best OTC creams I've used. I also use Retin-a (for wrinkle prevention) and find this to be a great night cream on the days I don't use the Retin-a.

  AFTER: The Adovia Dead Sea Salt soap can be used on your face or body (which is like a 2 for 1 bonus!). I actually used it on my face and body as I&#8217;m pretty dry all over. I typically don&#8217;t use bar soaps because they tend to dry my skin and make it feel really gross and unnatural. This soap is not made of unnatural ingredients, so I knew it wouldn't be a problem. I love Adovia products and this one is no different.I have been using this soap for about a week and have already noticed a difference in my skin. My skin has been so dry that it was almost flaking. I noticed that my skin has been softer, smoother, and more hydrated feeling. I also noticed that the almost flaking appearance has gone. I have also had no reactions to this soap at all, and it certainly has not left my skin feeling tight and gross like most other bar soaps do.This soap initially had a very strong scent after I took it out of the box, however when using it, it&#8217;s not at all strong and has a really nice, light scent that lingers in the bathroom and on your skin after using it. I really like that it leaves a nice light scent vs. a very heavy strong scent. I can&#8217;t really figure out what the scent is but it really is lovely.Adovia&#8217;s soap also lathers up nicely and washes away clean. You don&#8217;t have that feeling afterwards that it&#8217;s still on your skin. You feel nice and clean feeling after rinsing it off.  You really don&#8217;t need to try hard to get it to lather; it does so with little soap. After using a week, the bar still looks about new! I can&#8217;t believe how long this bar of soap is lasting. I&#8217;m also guilty of using this soap to shave with since it does lather up so nicely! It does work very, very well for shaving I have found. I think I might prefer it to shave creams/gels. I also love that it&#8217;s natural! I&#8217;m all about natural!

  AFTER: I received this product gratis, in exchange for a honest unbiased review.  I can say  with 5 stars, my skin loves this soap.  I love the texture, and how it fits perfectly in my hand. I barely drop the soap for it fits in my small hands just right, where regular bar soap feels awkward and super slippery.  This wonderful soap smells great and it is perfect for my dry skin.  I do not have to worry about showing off alligator legs when I use this soap.  I also love how the scent is fresh and clean, but not overpowering.

  AFTER: I love NYX, and I'm not surprised I love this mascara.  I normally use Clinique mascara, and when I say normally I mean everyday for the last 10 years.  I bought this because Clinique was out of my normal stuff.  I'm so glad I tried it because it's a great product.  It gives me length, and thickness.  It goes on smooth with no clumps, and the black is absolutely beautiful.  If you want a cheap mascara that wears like an expensive brand, I highly recommend this.  If you want something to just make your eyes POP and look amazing, then you definitely need to purchase this.

Perfect, in fact.  Was so excited to do mine with the Viking Winter by Just Gel Polish.  It was terrible.  It shrinks when you put in under the UV.  I did it over and over again and it kept shrinking!  Left bubbles and dents all over.  Lets just say it took bruising my nails to get it off and I hadn't even put the top coat on, yet.  Don't waste your time or money.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!

  AFTER: My daughter and wife have very sensitive skin. Regular soaps irritate their skin and make them break out. We have a water softener that helps, but we needed more help. We were given the chance to try the soap. My wife loves it. This is what she says about this great soap.It has a light, but nice fragranceIt has a nice lather that makes her skin feel goodThere is no residue left on the skin like many of the store bought soaps. We also have a water softener which makes this soap last a long time.The soap makes her skin feel softer and healthierWe see an improvement in my daughter's skin. Especially on her legs that get dried and itchy from other soaps.The price is a little expensive, but the soap does the trick and we got to try it for freeWould recommend this soap much more than regular bars of soap

  AFTER: I've been using IBD Just Gel for almost 2 years with my LED lamp at home. I adore this shade 'My Babe;' which is an opaque creme lilac/lavender. This shade coordinates well with 2014's color of the year 'Radiant Orchid.' It's versatile, being a medium light hue. It's a fun option and a very hip, tasteful Wes Anderson palette lavender - meaning a touch of retro appeal in a subdued hue in comparison to some Easter egg brights I've had before. I'm wearing it a lot this early Spring already. All I had in a lavender hue from IBD before was 'Amethyst Surprise' which is a semi-sheer frost with more neutral blue/grey tones and appeared darker with metallic highlights in appearance. This is my favorite gel lavender.

  AFTER: I purchased the needle roller after reading many mixed reviews. Some people swear by its usage while some people find it barbaric and would never even consider using it. I chose to try it as a last resort before undergoing any high cost beauty treatments. I'm in my mid-30's and it seems that when I use beauty products on my face they just sit on top of my skin. I wanted something that was going to help the beauty products penetrate my skin. I've only used the needle roller once and my experience was that while I felt as though I had gotten sunburn, it didn't hurt. It was more irritating than anything. When I used it, I did it before bedtime so that I could let my skin rest a few hours and take in my face product. I do recommend using a face product that is natural and that isn't harsh on the skin. I used an Eminence product which is natural and organic so as to not irritate my skin. I will say that after using the skin roller just one time, my face felt softer and looked much more refreshed than it normally does. I'm pretty sure the roller had something to do with it. So far so good.

  AFTER: I have thick wavy/curly hair and decided I needed a diffuser because my hair is getting so long that the curls were flattening (triangle head). I have been air drying my hair for years and I don't even know where my old hairdryer is, so I decided it's time for a new one and I will try to use it.I just wanted an inexpensive, dependable dryer with a diffuser attachement. This one works just fine. 3 heat settings and high/low setting. I had forgotten how good curls look when diffused after washing. :) Definitely recommend if you have curly hair and just want a a good ol' dependable diffuser, nothing special.

  AFTER: It made my hair crunchy and dry. I guess it's just my hair texture, and I have 4C hair, but it made it crunchy. Maybe you're only supposed to use it on the scalp, because I used it on the length of my hair. I will keep buying it, because it is a good moisturizer for dry lips and skin, but does not do anything for my hair and makes my scalp itchy.

  AFTER: WOW LOVE THIS HAIR DRYER. I called my stylist and asked her which is the best and gave her a couple choices.  She said Tourmaline Ionic Dryer. You can't beat this hair dryer and as one review from a stylist said she loves it and it is affordable vs. hundreds of $$$'s for the same thing that stylists use.  I use it with a Tourmaline Brush and I have curly hair which frizzes especially at the ends.  The tools it comes with like the finger styler and the round attachment for curly hair and a great dryer for this price is a great buy and I'm glad that it is affordable because not everyone can afford what they need. I'm grateful for the deal I got the day I purchased.  If I don't use my brush iron and wish to only use the dryer and my special brush then all I have to do is put a little pure argan oil on the ends and it smooths out the little friz on the ends.  Should I go curly the attachment is awesome. Helps to make the curls a nice style.  Shipping was on schedule and I'm a very happy customer. Almost forgot to add that you do get more shine as well. 100% happy.

  AFTER: Dead Sea Salt soap sounded to me like it would be coarse (like most exfoliating soaps) but it wasn&#8217;t at all!  It has a very clean, fresh scent to it that stays with me throughout the day.  There is no &#8220;perfumey&#8221; smell that is overwhelming like I&#8217;ve found with some soaps.  It leaves my skin feeling soft and looking smooth.  I love this soap!  I have used it on my babies and it has worked well with no issues.  I would definitely recommend this soap to anyone.

My favorite mascara before was from BareMinerals because my eyelashes looked natural but fuller with it. However, it was $20 for a small one. This one also does the same but I pay less! I totally love this one, plus the color of the barrel is green which is easy to see when it's in my purse.

  AFTER: I read a review (not on Amazon) of this mascara.  Sounded good, so I checked to see if Amazon carries it.  They do, and I decided to try it.  I needed a new mascara, anyway.When I shop for mascara, I check out price, product, performance, and packaging.  I want a product that works well, costs little, and is packaged in a manner suitable for use and preserving the product.  I prefer non-waterproof mascaras, and I like lots of length and volume.  In other words, I'm demanding, and not so easy to please.When I received this, I thought at first I'd received old product because it is SO THICK, it appeared to be dry.  Usually when you open a new mascara, you'll see a bit at the end of the brush you need to wipe off before you start applying it.  No, that wasn't there.  I started putting it on anyway, and SHAZAM!  It does add incredible volume and length, plus, if you twist the wand upward and outward, it adds great curl.  At first I thought, oh, I have too much of this on, but the curl softens a bit.As far as volume goes, you can get it with Cover Girl Lash Blast in the orange tube, or the L'Oreal or Maybelline volumizing mascaras.  They're very good.  But THIS one gets the lower lashes, too, without clumping.This mascara does not flake or smudge.  Even when my eyes are watery from allergies, my mascara stays perfect all day long.  It will clump if you dawdle when you apply it.  Just go at it with confidence.  You can speedily add layers while simultaneously brushing out any clumps.I'm ordering this, or the lengthening version, again.  I haven't tried the lengthening version yet.  This is a great mascara.  It exceeded my expectations.  The only caveat I offer is that because it is so thick, it does take me a little extra time to remove it.  I dab on somePond's Deep Cleanser & Make-Up Remover with Cucumber Extractto soften it before washing my face.

  AFTER: I ordered this product with the hope that it could help with a few white stretch marks on my hips. Note that I have had these marks since I was 13 years old and I am now 29 so the thought of finally minimizing them was worth the try. I did alot of research before I started and followed it religiously giving my skin enough time to heal and benefit from the rolls.I followed the rolling with a natural mixture of shea butter and coconut oil. Though the whole process is a little painful, its bearable and women go through much worse with waxing etc.Unlike others, I did not roll to the point of bleeding. Also ensure that you sanitize and store the product properly between uses.Its not a miracle product but after a few weeks I noticed that the stretch marked skin was smooth and you could no longer feel the indents from the mark itself ( they were still visible).This to me was the most improvement I have ever had in them having tried several creams and scrubs before. My problem with this product is that the needles go dull too quickly. I have ordered two times and both had to be discarded after a few uses. I really wish it was more durable.I will try this type of product again but maybe from a different brand.

  AFTER: My mom has type 4b or c or z hair, whatever you want to call it.  If you know the Andre Walker system, you know what I mean.  It is a beautiful hair type but very fragile.  She is 82 years years and last summer, had hardly any hair left in the front--not just the roots but the whole front of her head up to her ears had maybe 1/2  inch or less of hair remaining.  In the back, she had some hair, but it was ragged and all different lengths and felt rough.  She thought she was going to have to wear a TWA forever, like many of her friends her age who have basically jsut given up on ever having hair and shaved it off.  But she did not want to do this.  Though she is an older lady, she is very feminine and does not like her looks with this 'boy' type hairstyle.Anyway, to make a long story short, I sent her a bottle of this Jamaican black castor oil and she started massaging her hair and scalp with it.  I also made sure that she started sleeping on a satin pillowcase and wearing a satin cap, washing with her remaining hair in braids and using Shea moisture shampoo only on her scalp.  I told her to be very low manipulation and she wore a wig to cover up her damaged hair and give it a rest.  I taught her to finger comb only and also to use a little protein on her ends about once a month, after she washed. (Joico K-pak).  Lo and behold!  She lives in Florida and when I returned to visit her, barely 7 months later, her hair had grown so much!  the very short patches had grown a lot, the bald patches had filled in and the back had grown BELOW HER SHOULDERS.  My mother has never had hair below her shoulders in her life (this is difficult for many type 4b people as this hair type cannot take any abuse at all.  It was an unbelievable change.  My mother is so happy.  She continues to use this product as her scalp massage and moisturizer and her hair is not only growing like a weed but feels very fluffly, soft and not greasy at all.  Her goal is to grow her hair enough so that she can wear her natural hair in a bun and not have to wear a wig anymore and it looks like she will make this goal very soon.  We are both very happy.P.S I have type 3c hair which is a lot stronger than my mom's (my dad was mixed-race and I got his hair type).  I have never had balding or breakage problems the way she does,  but I find that this product works well for me, too.  I massage a little on my scalp mixed with some peppermint  essential oil (few drops) and burdock root oil (which I also bought on Amazon.com) every night and I don't have the itching problems I used to have sometimes before.  I think it makes my hair feel a bit softer (I have low porosity hair that tend to be dry) and I like it for me, too.

  AFTER: I was actually looking up body lotions with Sweet Almond Oil and the Aveeno Creamy Moisturizing Oil came up with the best reviews. From there I checked out the Aveeno Moisturizing Body Wash and this also had very excellent reviews. So I purchased both. I am very happy with these products. I used to use Olay Body wash but am now completely in love with these two products. They smell really good and make your skin feel dewy and soft all day. I also love that they contain Sweet Almond Oil, which is very difficult to find in products any longer perhaps because it is an expensive ingredient.

They didn't curl back down over my eye. My lashes on both sides also had length they never had before, but not fake stiff looking length. Also no flakes, no clumps and I didn't have to scrape it off at the end of the day, it came off like nothing with just a little eye make up remover.SO happy with this mascara, I finally found a winner.

  AFTER: Over the past few months, I have been trying many Dead Sea Salt and Mud products and have been very happy with them. It is no different with this Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap. The soap is in the form of a bar, which I do not typically use. However, I do not really mind it being in a bar. Actually, I think a soap like this would be more beneficial being in a bar form, rather than body wash. The Adovia Dead Sea Salt is white colored and virtually has no mess with it. I have used other Dead Sea soaps that while they worked made the biggest mess ever.The way I have been using Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap is by putting it on a washcloth that has a scrubby side to it. I find by using the soap with the washcloth, there is an added benefit and it helps to remove the dead skin. Personally, I have noticed a significant difference in the smoothness and the health of my skin. My skin is not irritated by the soap, as there is no smell or anything that would be an irritant.The soap is good for dry and normal to dry skin. My skin is combination &#8211; dry, oily and normal. With the dry spots, I have noticed that the soap is really helping to moisturize and smooth it. The normal parts of my skin, I have not noticed a difference. The oily parts, the soap has helped to subdue some of the oiliness, but it also is moisturizing my skin, so there is a bit of a different feel to it.My only problem with the soap is how expensive it is. It is $11+ for the bar. Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap does last a long time and has so many great benefits, so it is worth it, just really pricey.

  AFTER: For several years now I have been buying organic, all-natural lotions, shampoos, and bar soaps.  I was paying over $10 a bottle for Nature's Gate and other brands, but they leave my skin greasy and they don't really absorb, causing me to have to reapply frequently.  I recently tried this product out at work since we buy Aveeno to keep in the bathrooms there, and I was surprised to find it absorb better than Nature's Gate and it has absolutely no smell.  I have very sensitive and very dry skin, and this lotion keeps my skin soft for hours.The true test came when I decided to visit the Skin Deep cosmetics database and compare the numbers.  This lotion was rated a 2, which is pretty low for a non-organic brand, and my Nature's Gate was rated a 4!  I could not believe the number was lower, meaning that it's actually less toxic than the organic brand, according to the database.  I went out and purchased a bottle for myself.  It is pricey, but cheaper than organic and much nicer on my skin.

  AFTER: ..but I swear this dryer dries my hair quicker, and leaves it shinier, than other driers I've owned.  I'm generally not picky when it comes to driers, and basically purchased this one for its low price, so its good quality and magical hair powers have been a nice bonus.

  AFTER: At first it does a great job of building volume without clumping. By mid-morning, though, it starts to flake, and by the end of the work day, I have horrible black smears under my eyes.

  AFTER: I've used Covergirl products for years.  I'm pleased with this mascara.  It really is a Clump Crusher!  There's nothing worse than clumps of mascara joining 2 or 3 lashes together.  The curved, plastic brush is easy to use and keeps lashes defined.  My eyes look great behind my glasses.  I recommend Covergirl Clump Crusher.It's not just for girls - I haven't been a girl for decades but still like to use natural looking eye makeup.  I think it's almost more important as I've gotten older so I don't look faded or cranky.Well done Covergirl.

Perfect, in fact.  Was so excited to do mine with the Viking Winter by Just Gel Polish.  It was terrible.  It shrinks when you put in under the UV.  I did it over and over again and it kept shrinking!  Left bubbles and dents all over.  Lets just say it took bruising my nails to get it off and I hadn't even put the top coat on, yet.  Don't waste your time or money.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!

  AFTER: I have to mix it with glycerine to give it 'slip'.  When I mix it, I use it on my body---feels too thick and heavy to put on my hair.  I know some 'naturals' love this stuff but, perhaps I have a psychological resistance to just the words 'castor oil'.  And that old smell is still there.  Remember when your grandmother used to make you take it cuz you were plugged up?  Eeeew!Fortunately, no one can make me eat this stuff!  Perhaps if someone would share with me some incredible natural hair or skin recipe I'd incorporate it more into my routine.  But as it currently stands, I'll stick to my glycerine and coconut oil.

I just massage some of this JBCO on my head and it keeps it moisturized through out the day.  It's kinda thick which is nice because I don't want it to absorb into the wigs I wear.  I'm gonna keep trying it. A friend said that I should mix it with some shea butter along with tea tree oil and that should sooth my scalp as well.  I will probably buy again.

  AFTER: Cleansing every morning has become a spa like experience thanks to Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap. I work the Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap into a deep, rich lather and rub in small concentric circles around my face until it is completely covered in the Sea Salt Soap at which point I begin to rinse with cool to warm water until all traces of the soap have vanished.My skin has never felt so clean, and I am being completely honest with you when I tell you that washing my face has never been so pleasurable. I&#8217;ve used liquid face soap religiously for the past 10 years, at least, not a bar soap, but I am loving the results I&#8217;m getting from Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap. I used to only wash once per day, in the morning, because the liquid soap left my face feeling dry and tight, but with Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap, I wash morning and night.There is never a residue with Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap and my face feels refreshingly clean. Adovia&#8217;s bar soap lather is very light whereas the liquid soap I&#8217;d been using felt like there was always a layer left on my skin. I hadn&#8217;t noticed that leftover residue until I switched to Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap and I don&#8217;t think I will go back to a liquid cleanser again.The price point is right up my alley. At $11 a bar, I feel like I am getting this cleanser at a steal. Compared to other bar soaps I&#8217;ve used in the past as a cleanser, I don&#8217;t feel that they lathered as well or left me feeling as fresh and clean as Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap.Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap also has an amazingly clean fresh scent that you can smell before you even take it out of the box. I love awakening my senses to the smell of Adovia&#8217;s Dead Sea Salt Soap in the morning. It makes me feel like I am doing something good for my skin and feeling good in my skin couldn&#8217;t come at a better price.

It is an amazing at what it's uses are all for, a lot of cure alls in one product, bonus there. For the hair it is thick so you do not need alot. Ilike to use after a hot bath as it soaks into your damp skin and you can really reap the rewards, especially before bed when your body recharges and heals. Strong believer in oils, and great to chase away dry skin!

Some of my hair came out because of heat damage, I stupidly was hot combing my hair sometimes twice a day and some of my hair said NOPE and bye bye. I was devastated, one side was the shortest it's ever been, a bit past my ear lobe. I did not give this a 5 because I'm still waiting for the extra umph that goes with JBCO but it's been less than a month and my hair has grown back. I am AA with SLOW growing 4b hair so slow I can scream, I've mixed this product with pepppermint oil but I fully believe that my hair would not have grown back as quickly as it has with this product. Did I mention how SLOW my hair growth rate really is? It is thick so I diluted it with a melted hair growth grease, rub it in every night, and braid my hair into 2 braids and take it out in the morning. This is "THE" miracle product! I fully believe my hair would still be short if I wasn't using this product. This is a must get for all women!

If you do the research like I have you will find Olay Regenerist in the top 10 of all other moisturizers along with the most expensive ones. No one believes I'm my age and even had people want to see my drivers license to prove it. You can't go wrong with Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream. I can't live without it. This is a 5 star plus rating for me. Try it and see the difference it makes.

  AFTER: I've always had a problem with mascara clumping. A trick I learned from a makeup artist is to very gently roll the wand in a tissue before applying; it works. This mascara is really good at NOT clumping right out of the bottle. However, it doesn't seem to build & lengthen my lashes as much as my L'Oreal Voluminous mascara. I needed to apply 2 coats to get my lashes thick looking (like the L'Oreal does in one coat) and after doing that, my lashes were mostly uncurled. I've always felt that the CoverGirl mascaras are too wet/thin. They tend to make my eyelashes "uncurl"/straighten out after curling & applying the mascara. This new formula is better than others but still uncurls.The positive part is this mascara did not clump even with 2 coats. But, my nicely curled lashes were no longer very curled. It does wear well; minimal flaking & no smudge after a long day. So I guess if you prefer minimal thickening/lengthening of your eyelashes, this would be a good product for you. I'm not sure I'll keep using it because I prefer a thicker looking lash but it is a good mascara & worth a try if you've had problems with clumping.

I massage this stuff on my scalp every night and notice that my hair is thicker and softer after 2 months of use. It may be a little thick for some, but a good solution would be to mix it with another oil like coconut or jojoba.

  AFTER: There are several key things that I look for when it comes to trying a new soap or body wash: scent, lather, how easily it washes off the skin, how my skin feels afterwards (including if my skin feels moisturized or dried out), if I can use it on my face/shave with it and how long the soap lasts. I wasted no time in putting this soap to the test.Scent- This soap smells AMAZING. The best way I can describe the scent is to say that it smells really &#34;clean&#34;. There is something else to the scent (faint floral notes?) but I can not place it. I thought the smell was a little overpowering when I first removed it from the box, but it isn't overpowering as you use it in the shower. It actually makes your entire bathroom smell amazing for hours after your shower. The scent also lingers a little on your skin (not a lot, but enough to be pleasant and make you feel clean).Lather- This soap not only lathers well, but it does so easily. You use very little of the soap when in the shower.How easily does it wash off the skin- Very easily. It does not stick to your skin or make you feel like you have to work to rinse it off.How does my skin feel after using- I feel really clean and smell amazing. The soap does not dry out my skin at all like most soaps do. My skin doesn't necessarily feel moist, but it doesn't feel dry or sore either. It feels soft, clean and healthy.Can I use it on my face/shave with it- Yes! If I use other bar soaps on my face it is peeling and dry when I get out of the shower. I have been using this Adovia Mineral Soap on my face for 2 weeks with no peeling or dryness. It makes my face feel so much cleaner than the facial wash I was using previously. I love it on my face! I have also not had as many breakouts. I have also been using this to shave. Since it lathers so well and is not drying, it makes shaving really easy.How long does the soap last- Well, I have been using this soap for about 2 weeks now. As of now the bar looks almost the original size. You can even still faintly see the Adovia stamp on the bar. It appears that this Adovia Mineral Soap will last for a long time.As you can see, the Adovia Dead Sea Salt Moisturizing Mineral Soap passed all of my tests with flying colors. The soap is currently on sale on Amazon for $11 with free shipping for everyone. I normally would not spend that much on a bar of soap, but this soap is definitely worth trying. I recommend it!

  AFTER: The soap smells amazing. Very fresh, very clean and not overpowering. It does not  get soggy in the shower after use. Something that I love because I really detest soaps that melt due to moisture and the mess it creates. This soap lathers a lot. Another thing I love. And it washes off easily and doesn't leave any residue so we know for sure impurities are being washed off. I have definitely seen an improvement with the acne on my skin. It has not fully disappeared but it has started clearing up. The redness is easing and those that did scare are lightening. The soap does not give me any extra moisture, so I still resort to my lotion application process of coconut oil and then my regular body lotion as normal.I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.

I had a half dollar sized patch at the top front of my hair that had visibly thinned.  I believe it was due to the tremendous stress I was under at the time, but no matter the reason for it, it was there.  After reading some things said about this product in a Natural Hair forum on FB, I decided to give this a try.  I applied it morning and night with a Q tip to the effected area over the course of a month.  At the end of that time I parted my hair and noticed that the thinning was less than it had been, and called my daughter over to verify, and she saw it too.  I've not been as diligent in using it since then, but I have noticed that the hair has not thinned again, nor has it filled in any more than it had when I was using it.  I stopped using it as often and then not at all because since I wash my hair once a week, the area in which the product was applied took on a very oily feel, so while I may try using it again, I will likely limit the use to once per day.Hope that helps.

  AFTER: I'm not sure this thing works but I'm sure it is a bit painful. I'm also not surprised that Angelina Jolie is one of the folks who endorses it....she looks like she's might be into a little pain from time to time, I'm not. If you don't mind feeling like you've gotten a wind burn, you might like to use this small instrument of torture and maybe it will exfoliate or something but I've found no evidence of anything beneficial in my case.

  AFTER: This soap smells nice and soaps up well.  It does not clog my pores or dry out my skin either.  My only complaint is that it does not moisturize as well as a body wash.  The soap, as with all bar soaps I have used, leaves a tight, almost draggy feeling on my skin.  Therefore, I would pick a body wash over the bar soap formula.

  AFTER: I have sensitive skin, and often times do not wash my face. I was excited to try this product after trying several other products from their line, and am glad I did! I had no reaction when I used it, and it left my skin feeling hydrated! I dont use much when it comes to beauty products, but this line is defiantly worth the buy! its a little more expensive than just a regular bar of soap, but I limit it to my face, and don't share! Its a very smooth soap with an even smoother feeling after use!

  AFTER: For home, I buy the 18 oz. twin pack.  This 2.5 oz size is perfect to keep at work and to take while traveling (carry on approved).  I have never found a lotion that works better.  Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion is especially good to use while at work because it does not leave an oily or greasy residue that makes hand slippery.

  AFTER: ok....heres the thing...im indian mixed with black.....i have 3b/3c type hair.  Now i love this hair dryer.  I have an issue witth frizz, obviously because of my looser curl pattern, particularly with the front of my hair.  normally i dry my hair turban style with a cotton t shirt, but i find myself pressed for time lately.  i heard about this product and decided to give it a try.  and it is definitely worth the money, and space lol.  It left my hair less frizzy (i've come to terms that there will always be some friz), and silky soft.  had a nice shine to it, just like when i turban it.  now it did shrink my hair a bit, but it added volume and was nice and full, and gave me that cute non frizzy defined curl afro i was looking for.  The diffuser piece its self is actually pretty big, i was like where the hell am i gonna put this lol.  but its worth finding space for.  just a tip to avoid heat damage use it on a low warm setting AND DON'T FORGET YOUR HEAT PROTECTANT because i'm pretty sure no one likes fried hair.  i found the chord to be long enough, at least for me.  i don't ever use the other piece except for when i'm painting to dry things faster, or when i plan on flat ironing my hair, but i'm sure it has its purposes too lol.

  AFTER: Sometimes I skip foundation, sometimes I skip eye shadow... I NEVER skip the mascara. It's the one item of make up I truly care about wearing. (Well, that and lip gloss. Anyway...)This mascara is amazing. Though I haven't tested it in the rain- I CAN say that it is long lasting. I worked a 14 hour day and was too exhausted to take off my make up before hitting the sack, when I woke up in the morning my mascara still looked great. I haven't tested it in the rain yet, buttt it comes off very easily with some generic make up remover I have. (The easier it comes off, the better, for me.)This mascara does not clump. I love it. My eyelashes look long and silky- they don't look like gross spider legs with this stuff. No flakes, no smudges. Highly recommend this one!

  AFTER: The color is a true Coral color.I have purchased several IBD Polishes on Amazon and really like the Brand.  The price is fantastic (Around $7 w/ shipping) and it last a good 10 days with no chips before it starts lifting.  This is pretty typical length for Gel polishes on me and I am very happy with that time frame.You need an LED or UV light and you cure for 30 seconds.  You also need a PH bond, Foundation/Base and a Topcoat to cure in the Light as well.

  AFTER: I used to use Latisse, but it runs about $120.00 per month and, although I did see some improvement, it was not enough to justify the price. Then I discovered this product. After removing all makeup at night, I apply a bit to the lashes and lash line. I swear I see a difference - longer, thicker, and darker lashes. And it does not sting the eyes, or cause the slight skin discoloration that Latisse did.

  AFTER: I cannot say it enough; I love Adovia&#8217;s products. Yes, there has been one that disappointed, but that was just my opinion. Adovia&#8217;s Moisturizing Mineral Soap with Dead Sea salt is next to the top with their shampoo product.The soap bar is about the same size as a standard bar of bath soap you would find in a store. It has a natural fragrance to it, so it is not overbearing. I started using it to clean my face and within days some of the smaller blackheads just below the surface of the skin started to disappear.On those days when I am especially in need of a deep clean due to exercise or whatever, I will wash my entire body with this mineral soap. Every time I will come out feeling fresh and renewed.This soap moisturizes the skin although you would almost swear that it strips you of every drop of moist skin as you come out of the shower feeling &#8220;squeaky clean.&#34; If you want to experience a fresh and clean feeling, then this is the soap to use.

  AFTER: This soap helps to defeat dry skin!  I love this soap and cannot say enough good things about it.  It smells great and rinses clean with no film or residue. It also gently exfoliates your skin.  I started using it on my face but when I saw how much better my skin looked started using it on my whole body.  Let me give you some back story about my skin, it is a dry, flaky, rashy, hot mess.  So when I first tried this soap I wasn't expecting much. After using in once, I noticed the skin on my face wasn't tight feeling like it is when I use my normal soap.  My face was soft and smooth.  So I tried it on the rest of my body, and what a difference it has made! I now longer have to apply lotion continuously all day long. Once and I'm good to go!  Also, I'm not trying to make any health claims or anything.  It could just be coincidence but after using this soap for a week, the eczema on my arms ( that has been there for years) has cleared considerably, and my skin is no longer painfully dry.  If you have skin issues, give this soap a try and see how it works for you. For me it has really made a difference! Thanks Adovia!

  AFTER: Cleansing every morning has become a spa like experience thanks to Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap. I work the Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap into a deep, rich lather and rub in small concentric circles around my face until it is completely covered in the Sea Salt Soap at which point I begin to rinse with cool to warm water until all traces of the soap have vanished.My skin has never felt so clean, and I am being completely honest with you when I tell you that washing my face has never been so pleasurable. I&#8217;ve used liquid face soap religiously for the past 10 years, at least, not a bar soap, but I am loving the results I&#8217;m getting from Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap. I used to only wash once per day, in the morning, because the liquid soap left my face feeling dry and tight, but with Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap, I wash morning and night.There is never a residue with Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap and my face feels refreshingly clean. Adovia&#8217;s bar soap lather is very light whereas the liquid soap I&#8217;d been using felt like there was always a layer left on my skin. I hadn&#8217;t noticed that leftover residue until I switched to Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap and I don&#8217;t think I will go back to a liquid cleanser again.The price point is right up my alley. At $11 a bar, I feel like I am getting this cleanser at a steal. Compared to other bar soaps I&#8217;ve used in the past as a cleanser, I don&#8217;t feel that they lathered as well or left me feeling as fresh and clean as Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap.Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap also has an amazingly clean fresh scent that you can smell before you even take it out of the box. I love awakening my senses to the smell of Adovia&#8217;s Dead Sea Salt Soap in the morning. It makes me feel like I am doing something good for my skin and feeling good in my skin couldn&#8217;t come at a better price.

  AFTER: I haven't been using this oil for long, but I am an instant devotee! About me: African American & Native American; natural, kinky curly hair; acne prone, dry skin; 28 years old.I tried this oil before, when I first stopped straightening my hair. I hadn't quite gotten acquainted to the needs of my hair at the time, and tried slathering it on with nothing else. That was a massive fail - it was too thick - no comb was getting through that!Fast forward two years, as I began the oil cleansing method (OCM) with good results, trying only coconut oil. During this time, I started to read how people love castor oil the most for the OCM, so I gave it a try again. This time as suggested by others, I mixed it 50/50 with a lighter oil to make it spreadable - extra virgin olive oil. The results were MAGICAL.My face instantly fell in love - removing all dirt, grime, make-up, dry skin, and leaving my face supple and delicious, and karate chopping the few acne spots I had. That lead me to trying it on my body as a moisturizer. OMG - DELICIOUS SKIN! Mind you, I have terribly flaky, dry legs. BE GONE, said the castor oil!Then I tried it on my kinky, curly hair - BUTTER! It made my hair softer than it has ever been in my entire life. My hair was in a good state already, but there was some minor breakage every time I detangled or manipulated my hair. Not any more!The best part about this - there is NO GREASINESS. I mean NONE! No more stains on the clothes, no more greasy head rests in the car... I am in awe! BUY IT!*Drops the mic and exits stage-left*

  AFTER: I was given the opportunity to try this soap. I was hesitant because I DON'T like bar soap. I haven't used it in 15 years. But I can say I was pleasantly surprised with the feel of this soap on my face. There is good lather and a mild scent. Which is good because I don't like scented products on my face. It also did not dry out my skin which was wonderful. I can recommend this bar soap.

  AFTER: I ordered this product with the hope that it could help with a few white stretch marks on my hips. Note that I have had these marks since I was 13 years old and I am now 29 so the thought of finally minimizing them was worth the try. I did alot of research before I started and followed it religiously giving my skin enough time to heal and benefit from the rolls.I followed the rolling with a natural mixture of shea butter and coconut oil. Though the whole process is a little painful, its bearable and women go through much worse with waxing etc.Unlike others, I did not roll to the point of bleeding. Also ensure that you sanitize and store the product properly between uses.Its not a miracle product but after a few weeks I noticed that the stretch marked skin was smooth and you could no longer feel the indents from the mark itself ( they were still visible).This to me was the most improvement I have ever had in them having tried several creams and scrubs before. My problem with this product is that the needles go dull too quickly. I have ordered two times and both had to be discarded after a few uses. I really wish it was more durable.I will try this type of product again but maybe from a different brand.

  AFTER: Due to Hypothyroidism, my skin is very dry and requires constant moisturizing.  My feet are always super dry and on the verge of cracking at the heels no matter what I do.  I stumbled upon the Castor oil after ordering the Jojoba oil and thought "Why not".  My cabinets are full of expensive products that never worked and eventually are thrown in the trash.  It seems that Castor oil has many uses so I thought it couldn't hurt to give this a try and the price was right.  My feet no longer have the super dry and tight feeling and the cracking has gone away.  I didn't realize how tight the skin on my feet felt and how much discomfort it was causing.  I have started using this on my arms where I have age spots due to my sun loving lifestyle.  I could swear that the smaller spots have almost disappeared and the larger spots seem to be fading. The jojoba oil is great for my hair, but didn't do anything for my feet so it really takes the heavier Castor oil to get the results.

  AFTER: I am trying another Adovia product. I have enjoyed many of their products, and this dead sea salt soap is no exception. It is a pleasantly scented white soap that is very gentle on my skin. It contains over 26 Dead Sea minerals and trace elements derived from Dead Sea salt that cleanse and lightly exfoliate skin. I use this on my face and on my body and have not had any irritation or dryness. My face feels soft and clean.I love using this under my arms. It is very gentle and soothing and cleans me well. I am sulfate free and always looking for a nice alternative to chemical based soaps. After my shower,I apply organic coconut oil (small amount) under my dry under arms to prevent bacteria (bacteria is what causes odor (not sweat)). When the coconut oil dries, I put on my LaVanila lemon vanilla natural deodorant or I use my homemade mixture of tea tree oil, eucalyptus oil, lavender oil, coconut oil, coco butter, arrow root and baking soda (works amazing with no odor, lasts until the next day for me). This Adovia soap cleanses my skin well and makes a great preparation for my armpits before I apply my deodorant.I like how this has natural ingredients and there is not a long list of unfamiliar sounding chemical ingredients. I have used this soap EVERY DAY for the last month and it has lasted me well. I still have half a bar left. It does not leave a film or sticky residue and it does not have a strong fragrance. It smells clean and fresh. I think it would be excellent for those with acne or problematic skin.Key Ingredients:Dead Sea Minerals - Over 26 minerals essential for skin health including:Zinc: An antioxidant that facilitates skin cell renewal, helps repair damaged tissues,and heal wounds. Zinc is beneficial in stimulating Collagen and Elastin production.Bromide: Relaxing and soothing effect on the skin cells.Sodium: Improves the skin's ability to fight the free radicals that speed the aging process.Sodium in skin care can promote youthful and healthy skin with gentle skin softening and exfoliation.Calcium: An important ingredient in skin cell protection.Magnesium: Stimulates protein synthesis.Palm Oil - Natural oil forms the base of this soap. Allows for gentle cleansing and moisturizing without over drying.Full Ingredients: 80% Palm/ 20% Palm Kernel oil, Dead Sea Salts, Magnesium, Sodium, Potassium, Deionized WaterIf you found this review or any of my other reviews interesting or helpful, please rate is as &#34;helpful&#34; and or leave a comment.

  AFTER: I've had all kinds of skin treatments. Thermage, Fraxel, Cosmelon, Alpha Hydroxyl Acid Peels, even a couple of Jessner Peels and I used to use Retin-A. So far, this Needle Roller has been one of the most effective and least expensive things I've tried yet. I read up on it before purchasing and in some cases people have paid as much as $100 for one of these gadgets, so the price was really the main thing that attracted me. I chose the 1.00mm size as it was stated elsewhere that the larger 1.5mm and up will puncture the skin too deeply and cause bleeding. This size seems to be perfect. It abrades the skin enough so that serums (I use Skinbiology Copper with it) will penetrate and be more effective. The abrasion also triggers a "healing response" in the skin, so age spots, scars, etc. (which I consider to be a result of "incomplete healing") have a chance to further heal and diminish or go away entirely. I clean my roller after each use by squirting rubbing alcohol over it and drying off the excess with a blow dryer. It comes in a handy clear plastic case for storage that prevents the needles from touching anything so they remain clean and won't bend. You roll it on an area back and forth about 20 times each direction. Not the most pleasant sensation, it feels like a cactus rubbing on my skin. You can use a numbing cream with it, which I haven't tried yet--but I will. It causes a reddening similar to a sunburn that is usually gone by morning when I use it at night. Otherwise I am able to cover it with some concealer (I use either GloMinerals Camouflage or Eve Pearl Salmon Concealer). I noticed the very next day, after the 1st use, how much younger and better my skin looked. I've also been using it on the back of my hands and they are also looking younger as a result. I have a DPL and a Lightstim that I use twice a day (both) and I think that ALL of this combined, Derma Roller, Copper Serum, high quality cosmetics and LED red light therapy are a MUCH more effective and extremely affordable way to improve the appearance of my skin, especially in comparison to the $$$ I wasted at the dermatologist's office on the treatments I had (was talked into). And it's done in a slow, subtle way that is probably better in the long run for my skin.

  AFTER: Something was just off about my appearance when I was using Very Black (or whatever the darkest black shade is). I'm Asian and my hair is a very dark brown with a reddish warm hue, so even though subtle, the blackest black shades just looked a bit artificial. This Black Brown shade is amazing. I love that my makeup looks softer, more natural, and without any clumps in sight - are they natural? Is she wearing mascara? I love it. The brush is just perfect, too - very rarely make mistakes and I manage to get every hair I want to. Sometimes reaching the hairs near the corners can be frustrating with other types of brushes, but this gets every one, and I don't end up with clumps in the process!

With this mascara specifically you get a lot of presicion, and coming from me thats a lot to say(always need to rescue my makeup with Q-tips because I simply can't apply the mascara without a mess cuz my hands shake a lot), I couldnt believe how easy was to apply it on my lower eye lashes and no clumps either, cant say is the best one I've ever used but its pretty good.... The bad part about this type of brush is you cannot roll it over into your eyelashes but I guess this one makes it up.

This lotion provides long lasting moisturization, as well as good sun protection for every day exposure. One pump on my hands soaks in quickly, what little scent there is dissipates after a few minutes, and my skin is moisturized without feeling greasy.

  AFTER: I LOVE this mascara!  It really makes my lashes pop and it doesn&#8217;t smudge or flake throughout the day.  It also comes off clean with my face wash which is great because I hate when mascara is hard to remove and you lose lashes in the process.  And best of all NYX is cruelty free!  I highly recommend it, also as a little back ground I have sensitive eyes and occasionally get eyelid eczema flare ups and I have not had issues with this mascara.

  AFTER: I tried this one while hiding out from the world in Crisfield, Maryland for the Christmas-New Year holiday season with my relatives.  I like it a lot!  I am an "Olay" fan anyway, but have also used some other products.  I heard on the TV that the Olay Regenerist line was "the best" or something like that, so here is my story:It has a nice creamy texture.  It goes on your face smooth and it just really feels good going on.  It does have a semi-heavy scent blast that hits you when you put the first smear on, but it is not overwhelming and it seems to disipate quickly.  My preference would be to have it without the scent.  The cream just feels really good going on your face, kind of like putting your face on a cool satin pillow.  The cream soaks in really nice too.  It does not feel like it's going to rub off on the pillow when you hit the bed 5 minutes later like some other creams do.  It also does not feel sticky like some creams do.  After 4 days use on my face and neck, morning and evening, my face and neck feel really nice and soft (silky soft).  I would think (based on my initial results) that this cream would have really nice results when used over an extended period of time.I believe this cream holds its own against the other face products that I use, which include the Victoria Principal line, the Olay line, and the Seacret line (in the malls, from the Dead Sea). (I switch around between the products.)The directions are really hard to read on this 1.7 oz red jar but they say the usual.  They tell you to apply in small circular motions and avoid getting it into your eyes and to rinse with water if you do. (Duh.  A no-brainer.) It also suggests that you focus on areas like the brow and jaw line.  Olay is a Proctor and Gamble product.I think it is also important to tell you that I am NOT one of those 25 year olds who has young skin anyway and is trying to tell you how beautiful my skin is. LOL.  No offense, but the young whippersnappers haven't had time to mess up their skin yet!  I am 60 years old and am very pleased with my skin.  It is equally important to tell you that I did nothing special to my skin until about 4 years ago when I began a regular face cream routine.  Those 4 years have paid off big time, so if you think it is too late or you are to old to bother, that is probably not true.  I have had plenty of compliments on my skin.With all that said, I recommend a good quality face cream, before bed and upon waking.  This (and the other Olay products) seem to be worth your time and money.  When you do your face, include your neck too.  It shows.  Rub it on in small circles, like they suggest, and rub up (not down). Ohhhh, might I also suggest no frowning.  Only laugh lines are allowed :-)

  AFTER: I needed a hair dryer to use about once or twice a month. I found this at a great price with mostly good reviews so I decided to purchase it. I am transitioning to natural kinky/curly hair and have BSL hair overall. I almost always air dry so i needed something to dry it if I was ever in a hurry. What I was looking for was: at least 1875 Watt dryer, Ionic, Compact, With multiple attachments (at least comb, diffuser and concentrator), Not too loud. This dryer fills all those requirements... except for one thing: no comb-attachment.Since this came with two attachments, I planned to purchase the third one from Revlon. For those unaware, Revlon hair products are licensed to Helen of Troy. I contacted HoT to inquire about which model of comb would fit this dryer, since most comb attachments are expensive and I did not want to waste my money. They were very fast to respond but no one could tell me if there was one available that would fit. After a week, I received an email saying that they do not make a comb attachment that would fit this particular model. They said that this particular dryer has a specific nozzle so no other attachments from them, or other brands would fit it. I was disappointed, since nowhere in the package or description page does it say this. Perhaps I was naive to think that a company would never think not to make other attachments that would fit their best selling economy model, other than the standard out of the box ones. Now I have to think if this dryer was worth it at all. Who wants to buy a separate dryer just for that one extra task?About the product:Pros:lightweight, unbulky overall.Heats up considerably. Warm is an adequate setting for me, but it might be too hot for someone with very fine straight hair.2 attachments, including the concentrator.good value for the price.fast shipping.Medium noiseCons:Cord is too short. Does not rotate easily either.Very cheap plastic, i'm afraid this could melt with heavy prolonged use.Can only be used with the specific attachments that come with it (2), which are not for sale separately (If you contact Helen of Troy they might send you some for free if yours break)Diffuser is a joke. Not long enough for long hair to dry effectively. The fingers are too short and it's not concave so the hot air just stays in the surface. People's heads are nor flat, Revlon!Conclusion:If you use your hair dryer very often, for long periods of time uninterrupted, this might die on you. If you use it very irregularly it's a good balance between the price and use. If you want to use other attachments other than the ones that come with it, you might be out of luck. If you are purchasing this solely for the diffuser, I would stay away from this. Would I purchase this again if it broke down? No, I wouldn't, but it will do for the time being.

  AFTER: I bought this as one component of a shave oil I made for my boyfriend, but now I use it on my skin when it needs a little extra moisture. It seems to absorb well and be pretty much odorless. The price here is much better than the brick and mortar stores in my area, too.

  AFTER: Great mascara! I definitely like it better than any of the drugstore brands of mascara I have tried, and it's not that much more expensive. It's at a good price on Amazon (the same or cheaper than what I've seen it in the stores). It gives my eye lashes a nice full look, without the clumps. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants something more than the drugstore brands can offer but less that's less expensive than the department store mascaras.

  AFTER: This mascaras success is in the design of it's brush.You do get clumps but they can be easily combed out.Does provide the appearance of great volume and length to lashes.Is not water proof, as I found out on first use but this does mean it is easy to wash off.Just don't use this if you're going to watch a sad movie!Impressed with the curved brush as this is the means of "clump crushing".

  AFTER: This is not the best Mascara ever.  Just so you know, the best is the basic mascara made by ColoreScience. It's perfect. You get long, long lashes, no clumping, the wand is so good you should never throw it away. Just clean it with rubbing alcohol every now and then and use it instead of whatever wand you find inside any other mascara you are using, which you shouldn't be. ColoreScience is the best. But boy, does this come close.I don't want too much "volume." How thick should your eyelash be before you start looking like Tammy Faye Baker.  We want length and color. If your lashes are so sparse you look like Minnie Mouse, buy artificial lashes or, even better, get them individually applied by a make up artist for special occasions. But don't clunk up your lashes so they look gummy. This gives the right amount of lengthening and thickening, even if you put it on with a heavy hand.CoverGirl Clump Crusher goes on easily. To challenge their "no clumping" claim, I slathered on four coats.  Two coats of mascara should be the limit. Three...you're pushing it. Four...get your diploma, you are a Clown College Graduate.  But even four layers didn't make my lashes stumpy or weird. They were starting to look overdone, so I stopped there. If you wait a few minutes and let the mascara dry, you can use your lash curler...even a heated one, without creating a mess. YOu get a little flaking and flecking, but not too bad. Still, it's always better to do the curling first. I like the brush, it has an interesting angle and the bristles sweep away a lot of excess product when you brush it on.  The curve follows the curve of the eye, so one stroke goes from one end of the lid to the other.  Straight brushes can be tricky because they reach only a portion of the lashes. When you go back to do the middle and other end, some lashes end up with too little, some too much mascara.By the way, I got a great tip from a make up artist:  If you use eyeliner on the inner eyelids, your eyes look smaller and harder.  Instead, use white or very light blue. It makes your eyes open up and look bigger and younger.  Use it on the inner lids top and bottom. Also nothing gets rid of eyebags (I don't mean temporary puffiness from staying up late or partying, but real undereye suitcases), so save your money for the surgery. BUT caffeine does temporarily provide a little bit of shrinkage. Soak cotton balls in cold coffee left from breakfast and place on the bags, lean back and relax for 20 minutes.  It should make a difference. I have also heard that Preparation H works, but I believe the formula has been changed.  Perhaps we should be checking out the hemmerhoid cream reviews!Thanks for your patience. I think this mascara is a good deal, easy to use whether you use make up often or only occasionally, and is fairly foolproof.

  AFTER: I am a 23 years old black female with horrendous 10 years old light brown stretch marks running all over my forearms. I have been dealing with them since the age of 13 and haven't worn a tank top in the past 10 years of my life. I have tried countless creams, oils (and the list goes on) to get rid of them as laser treatment was out of the question (Laser treatment for stretchies is not designed to work on black people's skin), I have waisted hundreds and hundreds of dollars with no significant improvement, the horrendous stretchies were still visible and ruining my life. Around the age of 19 I decided to stop wasting my money and my hopes and decided to get used to the fact that I may never be able to rock a tank top or the strapless wedding dress of my dreams "Sigh".Then in summer 2012 I moved to Africa to stay with my mum for a while, the sun is really hot here and long sleeves tops are out of the question but since I don't have much of a choice...I decided to stick to my long sleeved tops but then I realized that I couldn't possibly spend the rest of my life hiding my arms in long sleeved tops...I just couldn't give up so I embarked on a new stretch marks removal journey.I started using my own blend of shea butter and natural oils because I heard that it was amazingly good when it came to fading stretch marks up to 50 %. So I faithfully applied my mix twice a day for 4 months non-stop, the process was extremely slow but little new skin patches started building over my old stretch marks, they were very tiny skin filaments like, very thin and see through, It was not very noticeable unless I looked at them closely...4 months for that little progress I was really annoyed but I kept going until I remembered reading about skin needling.I heard about it back in 2012 but at that time the idea of using a roller covered with needles onto my skin felt like torture to me and it didn't help that I was sceptical from years of living with false hopes and believing the hype about stretch mark treatments, so I never gave it a second thought (BIG MISTAKE, I feel like slapping myself on this one)So I decided to do my homework and researched skin needling, cons and pros, how it works...Basically its sort of a collagen, elastin rebuilder and that's what's lacking in stretch marks, the collagen stopped being produced while the skin was stretching, hence the appearance of stretch marks.I ordered the 1.0 mm without the numbing cream ( I just wanted to get used to the pain of rolling without numbing the skin first in case I went to a place where I couldn't get any). The first time I used it, I could barely tolerate the pain, so I only rolled it over the skin a few time without applying too much pressure. My skin turned red after a few minutes, and it was stinging a bit but nothing to cry over (The redness went down after 30 minutes and the pain an hour later). I then applied my shea butter mix, because apparently it penetrates up to 80% better into the skin because of the micro channels created by the needles.(I then proceeded to socking the roller into alcohol in order to clean it).Apparently it takes 30 to 40 days for the skin to be fully regenerated/healed, so I only roll once every 30 days to give my skin a chance to regenerate (but I still apply my shea butter mix everyday, twice a day).After the first 30 days had passed I noticed thicker skin patches (the filaments were getting thicker), new filaments appeared over my dented stretch marks too, I was seeing progress but nothing to be euphoric about...I thought maybe because I hadn't rolled properly the first time, there wasn't enough collagen produced to build more skin, so I decided that on my next roll I would do better.On my second roll (Second Month), I did it properly, I rolled all over my skin in various directions  (which I hadn't done the first time), I applied pressure evenly (even drew out a few drops of blood). The redness was way stronger than the first time and the pain was unbearable after the rolling, it was stinging badly, my forearms were painful, it all went down after 4 hours, I knew I had done a good job this time around. I also did not forget to clean my roller and apply my shea butter mix to my skin.25 days later my skin had very thick skin patches building all over my stretchies, even on the dented one, I can't believe this, they are turning into fragmented stretch marks because various thick patches of skin are appearing over them, The skin is even looking, healthy, thick and strong...30 days later the skin was still building, the patches were still getting thicker and more obvious, it's a miracle...I don't even know how to explain how happy and thrilled I am about this treatment. I have hope that my stretch marks will fully be covered with new skin in maybe a year or less. I will keep you guys updated every 30 days on my progress. Maybe some day I will wear the wedding dress of my dreams lolI'm sold, I'm a believer...Dermarollers are a wonderful creation, if you have old stretch marks or even new, give it a try. But remember consistency and patience are key (also the cream you use will determine how efficient the dermaroller will be on your skin).----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE: 08-Aug-2013 - End of the 3rd Month - Beginning of the 4th MonthIt's been a month since I last rolled my skin, tomorrow I will be derma rolling once again.I'm very excited and happy to say that this is the month I have seen the most improvement on my stretch marks, for those of you who don't know, tomorrow will be be the fourth month on my derma rolling journey.The following day after derma rolling at the beginning of the month, my skin had already started the healing process, there was already some new filaments appearing over a few spots, and islets of skin appearing within my dented stretch marks. As the weeks went by, the islets appearing within my dented stretch marks started growing outward towards my surrounding healthy skin and eventually started connecting to them to form fuller skin patches.The skin filaments that were thin last month have increased in size and the thicker ones have completely blended in with my surrounding healthy skin.My stretch marks are still visible but not as much as earlier this month, the thicker and fuller the skin filaments and islets get the more my stretch marks seem to fade or blend better with the healthier skin.I would say I have re-built 25 to 30% of healthy skin tissues over my stretch marks so far, it may seem little to some but to me it's the improvement I have been waiting for, for the past 10 years of my life.This month I have seen the most improvement on my dented stretch marks, which is surprising because I was expecting the shallow ones to heal faster but they seem to heal at the same speed or maybe  little bit faster (Which I'm not complaining about, on the contrary). I also believe that the use of my shea butter mix has played an important role in the skin healing process (it contains vitamin e and other good vitamins that are important for skin regeneration). Like I said and I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH, the lotion you use along with the derma roller will determine how well your skin will heal and how efficient the derma roller will be.One last thing that may be of interest to some of you, I now have hair follicles appearing where the new skin has re-built itself which is a sign that my damaged follicles are being revived, there is new hair growing out of them too, a sign that the derma roller seems to really heal the skin from within.I'm very excited and I can't wait to see the results of this month skin needling.I will keep you guys updated. My next update should be next month October 6th, 2013.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE: 06-Oct-2013 - End of the 4th Month - Beginning of the 5th MonthI know I'm a few days behind but I have been so busy with work and everything else that I didn't get a chance to sit down properly and write a review (I don't like rushing my reviews lol).Let's get to what we are here for. I derma rolled my skin on the 6th of October, rolled in various directions as usual (I stopped rolling really hard because just a slight pressure seems to do the trick). My stretch marks have improved by another 10%...so there is an improvement of I would say 40% overall. The way I would describe the way my stretch marks look now...it's like they are melting into my skin, they appear to be fading in, blending in...They have also really shrank in width which is unbelievable. I now feel less self-conscious about them because they are lot more discreet than they were when I fisrt started dermarolling. I think I'll need between 3 to 5 more sections before they are really gone. Not much to say, they are just filling in...I was so worried that the dermaroller might stop working after some time (like many people said) but it still works perfectly fine...my skin is still getting renewed. (See you on the 3rd of November for another update)------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE: 03-Nov-2013 - End of the 5th Month - Beginning of the 6th MonthI can't believe I forgot to dermaroll, thank God I remembered 2 days later...I have been too busy with work...There isn't much to report except that my stretch marks continue to fade...From now on I will be updating every 3 months until they have faded by at least 90 % otherwise I will feel like I'm repeating myself every time I update lol. At least 3 months is enough to see a huge difference...as of now my stretch marks have faded by at least 50%...My mother keeps saying your stretch marks are fading...she is so shocked, she can't believe it...I still feel like I'm in a dream, I would have never thought they would fade this much, I'm so glad I haven't given up.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE: 26-Jan-2014 - End of the 8th Month - Beginning of the 9th Month

  AFTER: I've always had a problem with mascara clumping. A trick I learned from a makeup artist is to very gently roll the wand in a tissue before applying; it works. This mascara is really good at NOT clumping right out of the bottle. However, it doesn't seem to build & lengthen my lashes as much as my L'Oreal Voluminous mascara. I needed to apply 2 coats to get my lashes thick looking (like the L'Oreal does in one coat) and after doing that, my lashes were mostly uncurled. I've always felt that the CoverGirl mascaras are too wet/thin. They tend to make my eyelashes "uncurl"/straighten out after curling & applying the mascara. This new formula is better than others but still uncurls.The positive part is this mascara did not clump even with 2 coats. But, my nicely curled lashes were no longer very curled. It does wear well; minimal flaking & no smudge after a long day. So I guess if you prefer minimal thickening/lengthening of your eyelashes, this would be a good product for you. I'm not sure I'll keep using it because I prefer a thicker looking lash but it is a good mascara & worth a try if you've had problems with clumping.

  AFTER: i haven't used any needle roller before and I did try it once, I don't think I even punctured my skin, I was barely touching it on my face and it was a little too much for me, but I am a sissy with pain. So I ordered the 0.5mm size and that one I can tolerate and do properly. Just remember to clean face and hands good, always use clean/disinfected roller. I just used the bleach and water solution and soak it for 10 mins, but just bought some alcohol and will be using the alcohol to disinfect it a little.When rolling, roll in one direction, someone recommended to just roll once direction, then lift and roll again. I did try that roll once, but now I get the hang of it, I can roll on the same area without moving the roller to much, repeat 8-10 tiems. When you move the roller while rolling it can potentially cut your face so please be careful. You will notice your face turning red and some areas where its not too red, then I just go over that area with a roller again. I had been doing this for 2 weeks now so haven't really noticed a significant change. But I can tell that when I applied the Hyaluronic with C & E, it really gets soaked up right away and my skin is softer. Also I was doing the peel and had noticed some chages on my pores, getting smaller, yeeey! So I really dont know whats working, but Im sure its the combination of Peel, Roller and Hyaluronic acid.

  AFTER: Aging baby boomers, my wife and I don't get out as much as we once did, but we do still go out occasionally. My wife has always used very light makeup, but she still uses mascara to highlight her eyes and long lashes. When she developed a slight tremble in her hands a couple of years ago, she was concerned about applying mascara for fear of injuring her eyes, so I volunteered to apply it. Surprisingly, she accepted my offer. One of her biggest gripes about mascara is its tendency to clump and look messy, so she was glad to try Clump Crusher.The product comes in a sealed bottle with a separate brush that you can see through the packaging. The brush is slightly curved at the applicator end, which has dozens of very fine bristles about 1.5 mm long. The round brush's handle is about 0.9" in diameter, which makes it easy to hold. That's the obvious stuff.In use, we both appreciated how the fine bristles separated and coated her lashes evenly with no noticeable clumping. I applied one coat of the mascara to both her eyes around noon yesterday, then we left the house for about seven hours to deliver Christmas presents and have dinner at a restaurant. When we returned, we both examined her eyes and found no smudging or flaking, even with a few tears shed at one stop. Later that evening, my wife removed the mascara with a washcloth and warm soapy water. It removed fairly easily with no visible traces left.Overall, the Covergirl Clump Crusher Mascara appears to be a fine product that works as advertised. My wife is sold on the product.

  AFTER: This is a powerful dryer, but it doesn't singe my hair the way most do.  I'm used to a smaller dryer, so the heft took a little getting used to, but my small ones never felt like a salon dryer the way this one does.  My one caveat is if you have a specific storage space, be sure to pay attention to the measurements.  I didn't, but I lucked out.  It stays in a drawer in my vanity that has an electrical outlet built in, and it fits in there with no room to spare.  If it's even lying on a hairpin or its own cord, the drawer won't shut. So, I'm glad I bought it, and I expect we'll have a long and beautiful relationship.

  AFTER: I enjoyed using this soap because it did leave my skin feeling very moisturized without feeling like it left a residue behind. I don't have to use tons of lotion afterwards because of how moisturizing it is, which is great (for my pocket as well as my skin). Personally, the smell wasn't too strong for my nose when I opened the box, but I did let it sit out for a couple of days before I actually used it so that might have calmed the scent down some. Overall I did enjoy using this soap.

  AFTER: I have had problems with dry skin conditions for more than a decade, and I've tried all sorts of moisturizing lotions, from inexpensive one to brand name lotions that have cost me a pretty penny. Finally I discovered Aveeno's moisturizing lotion, and I have had no problems with dry skin since. I apply it twice a day after my shower, whilst the skin is still moist, and the lotion glides on smoothly, absorbs into the skin, and lasts all day! It is really smooth, and in my opinion not really greasy. I dont even have to wash my hands after applying it. And its really good for my skin, the dryness has gone, and my skin feels smooth and conditioned. Highly recommended for dry skin sufferers!

  AFTER: I've changed my mind.....This mascara doesn't do it for me anymore.  I haven't been using this for awhile now cause the formula dries up quickly and worse I keep seeing a bunch of black flakes all around my eyes and cheeks after I put it on.  I regret buying another one.  I found another way better & cheaper mascara I've been using.  If you would like to know which one you can contact me.

  AFTER: This is a good product to use as a hair mask if you're trying to grow your hair out or eyelash enrichment product. I've also used it to help soften skin. It has a slightly harsher smell than some other oils but not terrible. Easy to use and affordable. I like all of the &#34;NOW&#34; oil products.

I stopped using the product and treated it with hydrocortisone and a non soap which cleared it up. I phoned Olay and they are sending a coupon to purchase another product. I've been using Olay products for years and have always been happy but this item is awful.

  AFTER: I've tried lots of body washes in an effort to relieve rashes, itching, and overall dry skin related to multiple allergies. If only I had tried Aveeno when it was first recommended, I would have spared myself much misery, multiple doctor visits, and a bag of useless prescription creams. After the first use, my itching was gone; within 3 uses the rashes had disappeared. For the first time in 40 years of pricey daily lotions and oils, my skin doesn't look dry at the end of the day. This body wash is AWESOME!

  AFTER: I imagined that when I opened the bottle liquid would be so thick due to reviewers. Now, I believe those reviewers were new to the ideology of castor oil. I'm a Caribbean (Dominica W.I) woman who grew up using Jamaican black castor oil which is thicker than this. It's a good size for the price. But not as thick. So that's the only reason why I gave it 4 stars. Package is good. Smell is authentic castor oil. No issues other than its not that thick so I can tell I will run out fast if I don't mix it with something else.

  AFTER: I came across this tool accidentally, didnt even know something like this was on the market, and when i saw it i decided to give it a try, because what it does totally makes sense . I have been using it for a few months now , it is a little hard to get used to it in the beginning, because of the tingling sensation , and the needles, but once you get used to it and start to use it properly you will see the results, now i use it about 2-3 times a week, and my skin has a better appearance because of better absorption of the cosmetic product applied, but it has to be used and paired with good quality cosmetics

  AFTER: This Dead Sea Salt Soap form Adovia is a good entry way into the world of bar soap.  It&#8217;s made of natural (and easily pronounceable) ingredients:  palm and palm kernel oil, dead sea salts (magnesium, sodium, potassium, zinc), demineralized water, and natural extract fragrance.  I feel pretty good about putting this on my skin and my skin feels pretty good about it too.Compared to shower gel, it&#8217;s not as moisturizing, but for a bar soap, it&#8217;s not too drying.  It leaves me feeling very clean.  It also does a phenomenal job of getting rid of funk.  Seriously.  This is the soap to use after a workout or a long weekend camping.  I think it gets rid of stink better than most shower gels I&#8217;ve used.I am also in love with the fragrance of this soap.  It has a fresh, clean, laundry dried in the sun smell that I wish I could bottle and spray in my car.  Because it smells so good, I wish the smell lasted longer on my skin.  But I&#8217;ll take it making my bathroom smell nice and crisp after I shower.

  AFTER: This works very well for body, but not so much for face. If any at all gets in your eye it feels like you just poured gasoline in  them and lit a match. Also even without getting anything in your eye they sting a little just from the fumes, particularly when it is still drying, but slightly all day as well.As I said it works well as a body moisturizer but leaves my skin feeling a bit sticky.

  AFTER: The Mineral soap arrived in great condition, in a cute little box.  It is about the size of a regular bar of soap.  My mom was here the day it came, and she said that it smells like ivory.  I thought it just had a strong, soap smell.  I know, imagine that, the soap smells like soap :-).  There is no perfume or fruity like smells, (which, really is to be expected from an all natural soap) and it was very strong. However,  During a shower, the smell is not that strong, and I really like how it smells on your skin.My husband is a carpenter, so he is around dust, dirt, and is sweating for a good part of his day.  I thought he would benefit from this the most. It has been a few days now, and I can feel a difference in my skin, as well as see a difference in my husbands.  His pores on his face and back do not look as clogged and yucky like they usually do,  he scrubs them twice daily, before the new Mineral Soap, and now, with it.  The new soap has clearly made a difference!  You can feel a tightening in the skin almost immediately, before even getting out of the shower. Soap DOES lather on a wash cloth! The bar seems to be lasting a decent amount of time. We have used it quite a bit and there is plenty left! I would most definitely buy this soap in the future, as well as recommend to everyone!

  AFTER: I purchased this item to replace an ancient, 1980's-era blow dryer, and based my choice on its excellent reviews. I have to agree, this is an excellent product. I first noticed that even on the highest setting the dryer did not get as hot as my old one. I thought this might be a problem, but actually it is an advantage as it won't burn you if you leave it in one place too long. The volume of air being pushed out of this dryer is far stronger than my old hair dryer, so it dries very fast. I have naturally wavy hair that tends to frizz and I used the dryer to straighten it. Much to my surprise, this dryer not only dried my hair very quickly, it left it very smooth with no frizz. It must be the lower heat with the strong blast of air that works so well. Whatever it is, I highly recommend it!

  AFTER: You must be crazy if you do not buy this product.  I have been using this product for about a week and I have to tell you my hair is longer and thicker and even healthier.  I usually use shea butter but because it is summer time I have to put the shea butter up until the winter.  OMG my hair is amazing and lovely.  Black Castrol works it works.  My edges are back and thick now and I have natural dark coloured jet black hair and it has help the shine in the hair. yes it is thick and the smell may not be to your liking but at the end of the day your hair will thank you bc hair needs natural ground earth products. ALSO you must eat healthy as well and exercise your hair needs that too. YOU MUST GET THIS.  You will not be disappointed. UPDATE!!! It is has been a year since I started using Black Castrol Oil and I STILL USE IT!!! What an awesome product!! My hair is extremely longer, thicker and healthier.  In the process I tried other products and ummmm no no ... does not compare.  I know people complain about the smell but it doesn't matter it works that is what matters.

  AFTER: I don't know who comes up with the names for products, but you have to laugh at some of them. "Micro-sculpting?" If it is "micro," what's the point, as any firming would be nearly unnoticeable, lol. In any case, a good product, when used with the overnight product, that really does leave your skin nice and soft and doesn't have any unpleasant smell to it (as many similar products do). If used as directed, a jar of this should last you 2-3 months (if you use it in the a.m. and p.m.). Generally I like the Olay Regenerist line. I am not a particular fan of a lot of Olay products, but the Regenerist line, I've always been pleased with their results. (I'm 47, very fair skin, only a few small wrinkles, or I guess they're called "laugh lines"--except who actually laughs at getting wrinkles?--not prone to blemishs/acne etc. I use sunblock in the summer since I burn easily. My skin tends to run slightly dry, and more so in the winter months. This, combined with the overnight sculpting lotion, never fails to leave my skin soft. I definitely notice when I do NOT use it.Would recommend.

  AFTER: I try to always be open and kind with all my reviews. Even the ones I don't care about too much. I try to always start on the positive note before I bring in the yuck factor. But there are times when the stars and romance meet in perfect harmony and I just love on something so much I just have to go tell it from the roof tops. Adovia has been that perfect beauty find for me this year. I have had the pleasure of trying several of their products and here is the latest.I recently tried the Adovia Moisturizing Mineral Soap with Dead Sea Salt and Minerals. A soap infused with amazing 100% Pure Dead Sea Salts from the Dead Sea. These salts contains over 21 minerals to deeply hydrate, cleanse and balance your skin. It throughrally cleanses your skin from grim, makeup, sebum and yet never stripping your skin from the vital nutrients and oils it needs. Leaving your skin hydrated, moisturized and feeling healthy. It is truly a perfect moisturizing cleaner for all skin types. Gentle enough for the sensitive of skins and yet balanced for the oiliest of skins.Oh, and did I tell you the smell is beautiful. Its a soft, and clean fragrance. Perfect to start off and end your day with. Truly a favorite.I know your thinking.... its a bar. No rethink that and give it a try. You will be impressed. It will not dry your skin as a traditional bar would. This is a moisturizing bar and it is made to cleanse and hydrate. All you have left is a soft, cleansed, and hydrated face. The bar thing is actually more of a benefit for this product. We are talking take it to the gym, after a day at the beach, on vacation, poolside, and even add it to the guest room this Summer. Since it fits all skin types it will fit all the needs as well.Definitely worth trying. Satisfaction is guaranteed. You have nothing to lose.

  AFTER: I love the smell and lather of this product. It will show signs of working after a few days and as everyone has a different skin tone and type this might not be for everyone and the results will not be the same. If your using this with another product that could cancel the effect as well.

  AFTER: I am so happy to finally have got it! Not sure why I waited for so long to check if Amazon carries castor oil. I used it primarily on eyelashes, and it really helps them to grow. I didn't know it could be used in all these many ways... Just tried to add it to my shampoo - and it didn't grease my hair at all, even though it's really oily at the roots. Quite the opposite - even added some volume! Can't wait to see its action! :)

  AFTER: I've spent my entire life looking for a mascara like this! I have thick, medium-length lashes, so I need a bit of a boost in the length department without insane, clumpy thickening. Every mascara I've tried that claims to define lashes without clumping has ended in one thing: clumping. I wind up having to go through my lashes with a metal eyelash comb in order to avoid looking like a drag queen. I've tried so, so, SO many mascaras (I can't even guess how many), from high-end lines to drugstore brands, with no real luck. But the second I put on this mascara, I realized it was time to dump every other tube in my collection. If they discontinue this line, I'll be heartbroken, because I already know this is my mascara holy grail.Update 4/24/13: I still love this mascara, but I have discovered that you can't sleep with it on. Whenever I do, I wake up with black smudges under my eyes. Yes, I know I shouldn't sleep in mascara--I'm not reducing my rating based on this, but merely pointing it out since I used to sleep inCoverGirl Lash Exact Mascara: Black Brown #910all the time with no problem. That being said, it's still my favorite mascara!!

  AFTER: I tried this a 2nd time on a friend's recommendation. If used OVER my Rosacea-treatment cream it's great.After a few months it actually seems to have decreased some fine lines. At first I thought I could replace Finacea (Rosacea Rx cream), but that's when I got into trouble...when I didn't use Finacea first.If used AFTER Finacea which really dries out the skin, especially around eyes and mouth...when used after (on top of settled Finacea), it makes my skin feel less tight and apparently has eased some fine lines...unreal!Retinol is murder on Rosacea-skin and most "wonder" products have retinol. This does not have retinol...TG!

  AFTER: The most I had ever spent on a mascara was about $6 and never ended up being happy with my lashes. I've tried all sorts of brands that promise volume, curl, length ect, but I guess I was never to surprised with my outcome considering the price. Despite that, I could never see spending $20 or more on a tube of mascara that would only last me maybe 6 months, and worst yet, what If I spent the money and still ended up dissapointed. I bought the NYX Doll Eye Mascara on a whim, but it turned out to be the best mascara choice I've ever made.I always start out curling my lashes with a revlon metal lash curler. Usually my lashes don't hold a curl, once I apply mascara there back to their usual straight selves after drying. With the NYX Doll Eye, my lashes held a perfect curl all day. My lashes also looked ALOT longer and I have pretty long eyelashes to begin with so the result was very dramatic.The first time I used this, I only applied one coat and was very happy with the results, minimal clumping but the formula is thick enough to coat each lash nicely, perfect dark black color, shiny and noticable. Since I only wear eye makeup I want my eyes to stand out and mascara is my favorite for this.The second and third time I experimented with more layers. If your going to put on multiple coats I would recommend not waiting in between coats for it to dry. If you do this the result is clumps and messy looking lashes. After curling, I applied a few coats ( the brush holds alot of the mascara on it so unless you wipe of the brush before applying you may not need more on the brush for 3 or 4 coats ) angling the brush to fit in with my lashes which adds volume and oomph because of the way it is shaped. I used to prefer the spoon brush ( for extra curl ), but this style brush gets every lash just right and it is fatter at the ends where your lashes are the shortest and sparse and really plumps them up. The result of 4 coats were beautiful "baby doll" lashes which in my opinion looked even better than falsies ( which to me look funny and fake ).If your struggling to decide whether to try this or not, you really should. For the price of only $9 you will not be dissapointed.

  AFTER: It doesn't clump...like the name, but it also doesn't give me the length I'm looking for.  I'm not sure why, but several times when using this item, I've ended up poking myself in the eye with it too.  I think it's the shape of the wand.  It's not awful...just not great.

  AFTER: It's not just for use as a nutritional supplement!Castor Oil has natural antioxidant properties, and absorbed into the skin it helps to naturally minimize and prevent wrinkles as well as stretch-marks, and it even conditions hair when added in small amounts to shampoo or deep conditioner treatment!Tip: A little added Castor Oil and natural vitamin E to a base of Coconut Oil or Jojoba Oil (ratios about: 1 part vitamin e oil, to 10 parts coconut oil and -part to 1 part castor oil) combine to make for a great all-natural body oil with full-on anti-aging properties!If skin is very oily, use it to spot treat areas (under eye area, stretchmarks, dry patches, hands feet) overnight and rinse in the morning. If skin is very dry, then daily use,full-on for the entire face and body will leave your skin noticeably supple and smooth and o-so--soft! Apply full strength overnight to dry hands and feet (cover with cotton socks and cotton gloves).Overall, it is an outstanding product, whether used to enrich smoothies or used topically. And a little goes a long way for healthier skin and hair.Our grade: B ; or 4-Stars!

  AFTER: I cannot say it enough; I love Adovia&#8217;s products. Yes, there has been one that disappointed, but that was just my opinion. Adovia&#8217;s Moisturizing Mineral Soap with Dead Sea salt is next to the top with their shampoo product.The soap bar is about the same size as a standard bar of bath soap you would find in a store. It has a natural fragrance to it, so it is not overbearing. I started using it to clean my face and within days some of the smaller blackheads just below the surface of the skin started to disappear.On those days when I am especially in need of a deep clean due to exercise or whatever, I will wash my entire body with this mineral soap. Every time I will come out feeling fresh and renewed.This soap moisturizes the skin although you would almost swear that it strips you of every drop of moist skin as you come out of the shower feeling &#8220;squeaky clean.&#34; If you want to experience a fresh and clean feeling, then this is the soap to use.

  AFTER: I read some great reviews for the Aveeno body wash and body lotion so I decided to try both of them. I use the Aveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Body Wash with Natural Oatmeal when I take my shower. It is like a cleanser that leaves my skin soft without the feeling of a film or an oil. After the shower, I follow up with this lotion.This lotion makes me feel moisturized. It blends into the skin quickly and easily and you can tell when the product has blended into your skin--you don't have to go on rubbing for ages. It doesn't really have much of a smell although sometimes I will get a whiff and it has kind of an odd scent but by the time you rub it in there really isn't a smell that I am aware of. This is great because if you wear perfume you don't have to worry about fragrances clashing. If you are like me and avoid perfumes, this is great because perfumey lotions make my nose itch and then I start sneezing.This lotion is not like any other lotion I have tried. It does not make me feel greasy like some lotions. The consistency does not feel watery so that while I am putting it on it feels like slightly thickened water and when I am done putting it on I know have to put on two more layers of lotion to get a decent layer of moisture on my skin. Unlike other lotions, my skin does not dry out and look dried out a few hours after putting it on. Unlike other lotions, this one is not overbearingly thick, requiring extra muscles to spread the lotion and rub it in.Basically, when you are done it feels like your skin, like you aren't wearing anything, like the way your skin is meant to feel rather than feeling like your skin is covered with layers of a moisturizing product.

  AFTER: I love skin and bath products.  I could never have too many of either! I recently tried Adovia Mineral Salt Soap and I was pleasantly surprised.  I knew it used Dead Sea Salt in it so I thought it would be very rough and grainy but it wasn&#8217;t.  The soap contains a unique combination of Dead Sea Minerals and trace elements derived from the Dead Sea Salt ~ so it was smooth and creamy.  It infused my skin with minerals, hydrated and moisturized my skin.  It had a nice scent and washed away completely.  It didn&#8217;t leave my skin oily just soft and lightly scented.  I used it in the shower on my face and body.The Adovia Mineral Salt Soap contains over 21 minerals key to skin health and beauty here are a few of them:Zinc: Facilitates skin cell renewal, stimulates Colagen and Elastin synthesis, Anti oxidant properties.Bromide: Relaxing and soothing effect on the skin cells.Sodium: Improves the skin&#8217;s metabolismCalcium: An important ingredient in skin cell protectionMagnesium: Stimulates protein synthesisPalm oil and natural oils form the base of the soap. That allows for gentle cleansing and moisturizing. Your skin will feel soft and look healthy.

  AFTER: I use this on my face for acne (which has really worked) as well as replacing my moisturizer and on my hair for softness (which has also worked.) I've been using on my face everyday for two weeks and my hair 1-2 times per week during that span. It looks like hardly any is missing from the bottle--so a little bit goes a LONG way! For the price offered here, you really can't go wrong. I imagine this will last at least 3-4 months.

  AFTER: I am so happy to finally have got it! Not sure why I waited for so long to check if Amazon carries castor oil. I used it primarily on eyelashes, and it really helps them to grow. I didn't know it could be used in all these many ways... Just tried to add it to my shampoo - and it didn't grease my hair at all, even though it's really oily at the roots. Quite the opposite - even added some volume! Can't wait to see its action! :)

  AFTER: Even though I disinfected with alcohol, I developed strange bumps under the skin on the back of my hands that became infected. My skin developed bumps that wouldn't go away for 3 weeks. This is very cheap and flimsy and there are much better ones out there. I ended up buying the SheEssentials 1 mm with 1.5 mm changeable head, and it was FANTASTIC! I paid a bit more for it, but it's way better quality and has a lot more needles than this did, 600 needles for the smaller head and 1200 needles for the larger one. I'm not sure how many needles this product has, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's 300. This means less skin will get punctured. I definitely saw much better results with the 600 needles. The fact that it came with two heads made the price comparable to this when you factor that in. The double-wide roller was a huge plus for larger areas as I have a lot that I'm treating and trying to roll stomach or thighs with a tiny roller would take days.Dermarolling has been amazing for me. I've had great results with my other dermaroller for stretchmarks and loose skin- in only a few sessions! It has given me hope that I thought I would never have again, when my body changed so rapidly from rapid, extreme weight gain and loss. It's a huge difference on 20 year old stretch marks that I thought would never go away. On my belly it 'raised' old, indented stretchmarks so they can now be healed and exfoliated.Dermarolling has given me so much hope and a lot more pride in myself and I can't recommend anything more strongly. It's definitely worth trying before other, more invasive and expensive measures. But please do your research first and make sure you are getting the best dermaroller for your money. Don't be afraid to pay just a little more for a product that will give you even better results. And please make sure you really research on how often to do it and what mm is best for your area of treatment. Also, just because I experienced such amazing results in such a short time, don't give up if you don't. From what I've researched, it can take several months of repeated treatments before some people see strong results. It depends on your issue, how long you've had it, and how fast your body is able to heal. Also on whether you are doing this correctly, so again I stress- please do very thorough research even if you just want to jump right in. If you don't give your skin time to fully heal, you'll destroy the results you are trying to achieve. You can actually break down the collagen that is trying to form from your last session if you do it again too soon!I hope this review helps anyone interested in dermarolling. I know how important it can be to have a little hope!

  AFTER: This is my second favorite mascara after max factor 2000.  As the product says, you get no clumps, and I like the fact that it comes in brown shades.  While this lasts on your eyes longer than max factor, it's not as build-able, so you get less dramatic eyelashes.  If you are just looking for a little emphasis and no-fuss mascara (for work for example), but don't need super big lashes, this would be a good product for you.

  AFTER: The only thing that I found true about this product's description - it has stayed "clump free"... BUT it absolutely DOES NOT give 200 times the volume like the description says.

  AFTER: I tried this as well as the regular castor oil, I love them both but would probably prefer this one over the other one. This one cost a couple of dollars more but it works better in my opinion. I have natural hair and my edges were thinning from a hairstyle that I had that was too tight, this grew my edges back almost completely in 45 days, I could see some growth after 2 days. I also put this on my eyebrows for fullness and have friends that rub a little on their eyelashes. I had no problems with shedding like I have read in other reviews. This is my 3 bottle that I have ordered. The only slight problem I had was a small amount of leakage when shipped.

  AFTER: Castor oil...the ultimate in skin and hair moisture. I mix it with almond oil for my elbows, knees, and feet (the roughest parts on my body). Works like a charm.

  AFTER: Is your hair thinning? Edges breaking off? Want thicker hair? This is the oil for you. One of my fellow natural hair bloggers recommended this product to me and I have not been disappointed. I do not have a problem with thin hair or breakage but I would to ensure that doesn't occur. I started using this product daily to apply to my hairline prior to smoothing it back. Since I've been using it, I've noticed that my hair all over is really thick and really strong. It has a nutty smell to it and a thick consistency. It smooths onto your hair very easily and is absorbed well.

  AFTER: I was actually looking up body lotions with Sweet Almond Oil and the Aveeno Creamy Moisturizing Oil came up with the best reviews. From there I checked out the Aveeno Moisturizing Body Wash and this also had very excellent reviews. So I purchased both. I am very happy with these products. I used to use Olay Body wash but am now completely in love with these two products. They smell really good and make your skin feel dewy and soft all day. I also love that they contain Sweet Almond Oil, which is very difficult to find in products any longer perhaps because it is an expensive ingredient.

  AFTER: I've changed my mind.....This mascara doesn't do it for me anymore.  I haven't been using this for awhile now cause the formula dries up quickly and worse I keep seeing a bunch of black flakes all around my eyes and cheeks after I put it on.  I regret buying another one.  I found another way better & cheaper mascara I've been using.  If you would like to know which one you can contact me.

  AFTER: I bought this because the base coat I've been using doesn't like to soak off. The polish will soak off, but the base is stubborn. (Ms Keiko's from china) This stuff doesn't even stay on for one day. Regular polish lasts longer than this. I hope the IBD top coat I have coming is better, but I'm not going to hold my breath. I will not be repurchasing. I suspect that if Amazon didn't lump all the reviews together, the rating for the IBD base coat would be far lower.

I love that it is 100% all natural too..there are no weird ingredients.  I was noticing a little flaking and dry skin prior to starting with the soap but after I started using the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Soap it seemed to stop. My skin has been looking really nice and it feels comfortable, not tight or dry.

I have been using it since my early 20's and am now in my late 50's. If you do the research like I have you will find Olay Regenerist in the top 10 of all other moisturizers along with the most expensive ones. No one believes I'm my age and even had people want to see my drivers license to prove it. You can't go wrong with Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream. I can't live without it. This is a 5 star plus rating for me. Try it and see the difference it makes.

  AFTER: For several years now I have been buying organic, all-natural lotions, shampoos, and bar soaps.  I was paying over $10 a bottle for Nature's Gate and other brands, but they leave my skin greasy and they don't really absorb, causing me to have to reapply frequently.  I recently tried this product out at work since we buy Aveeno to keep in the bathrooms there, and I was surprised to find it absorb better than Nature's Gate and it has absolutely no smell.  I have very sensitive and very dry skin, and this lotion keeps my skin soft for hours.The true test came when I decided to visit the Skin Deep cosmetics database and compare the numbers.  This lotion was rated a 2, which is pretty low for a non-organic brand, and my Nature's Gate was rated a 4!  I could not believe the number was lower, meaning that it's actually less toxic than the organic brand, according to the database.  I went out and purchased a bottle for myself.  It is pricey, but cheaper than organic and much nicer on my skin.

It arrived packaged perfectly.ProductThis product at first to me was a dud. I wanted to seal my polish ( Non UV Polish) which I do with my other UV coats. This product DOES NOT work with regular nail polish :(. Then I tried it on my overlay and it was tacky, much more tacky than other brands.It dries at a normal paceThe shine is a great luster shineSuggestions:Remember to use rubbing alcohol once you set the UV coat to remove the excess product build up and to remove the tackiness. Apply a really, really thin layer to get the best results.If you are looking a for a Top coat for your solar nails, natural nails and or overlays without polish this is a great product.If you are looking for a Top coat that will seal and secure ANY Polish..try Gelish or Seche brands.

  AFTER: I liked the base coat better than the top coat I purchased from the same brand. The brush is shorter than a standard nail polish brush which I found helpful and more accurate. You don't need more than a thin layer of a base coat and it was a great price. Similar to the top coat by IBD it says to cure for 30 seconds using an LED lamp. It took almost 3 minutes to cure the base coat using my LED lamp

It is an amazing at what it's uses are all for, a lot of cure alls in one product, bonus there. For the hair it is thick so you do not need alot. Ilike to use after a hot bath as it soaks into your damp skin and you can really reap the rewards, especially before bed when your body recharges and heals.

  AFTER: This is going to be one of those reviews where you wonder "does this person work for the company selling this product??" but I can assure you I don't have anything to do with them... I just love their moisturizer.  I have been using this for several months after purchasing it at a local big box store.  I have found other moisturizers to either be too greasy (leaving me with a shiny face) or too scented or too thin.  Some of them haven't "rubbed in" well and I find I have little white spots on my face later.This, to me, is the perfect moisturizer.  It has just a faint faint faint smell of something (Oatmeal?) very nice.  Just a little whiff that is one part Elmer's glue and 10 parts water and 10 parts oatmeal.  I know that doesn't sound that appealing but trust me, it's a nice scent.  It rubs in right away and leaves your face feeling really refreshed.  I fly a lot for work and often use this in the morning before a long flight.  I'm surprised well into a long (14 hour) flight how moist my face still feels.  So it lasts.You can read my other reviews and see I don't give out 5 stars very often...but I really like this product and highly recommend it.  I just ordered the same moisturizer with 15 SPF which sounds like an improvement on an already perfect moisturizer.

  AFTER: It's not just for use as a nutritional supplement!Castor Oil has natural antioxidant properties, and absorbed into the skin it helps to naturally minimize and prevent wrinkles as well as stretch-marks, and it even conditions hair when added in small amounts to shampoo or deep conditioner treatment!Tip: A little added Castor Oil and natural vitamin E to a base of Coconut Oil or Jojoba Oil (ratios about: 1 part vitamin e oil, to 10 parts coconut oil and -part to 1 part castor oil) combine to make for a great all-natural body oil with full-on anti-aging properties!If skin is very oily, use it to spot treat areas (under eye area, stretchmarks, dry patches, hands feet) overnight and rinse in the morning. If skin is very dry, then daily use,full-on for the entire face and body will leave your skin noticeably supple and smooth and o-so--soft! Apply full strength overnight to dry hands and feet (cover with cotton socks and cotton gloves).Overall, it is an outstanding product, whether used to enrich smoothies or used topically. And a little goes a long way for healthier skin and hair.Our grade: B ; or 4-Stars!

It is a little pinchy on the skin when you roll it, (sometimes it makesme sneeze when I do between the brow area)  but it opens up my pores and lets the product absorb down into the skin so effectively!!  My skin is luminous when I go to bed and refreshed in the morning when I awake.  I love it, It is of good quality and the price was FANTASTIC! I am hooked.  Thank you to the seller for the fantastic price, and the super fast delivery.

  AFTER: The best thing about this hair dryer is that it is very lightweight as stated.  The next best thing is that it does a nice job drying hair quickly.  I have LOTS of long hair and it's the best hair dryer I've had so far.  Would say I'd buy again, but I bought 3 of them for each bathroom.  Sometimes you find a product you like so well you want a backup just in case ... this is one of those products.

  AFTER: I bought this to do french tips, in which if does wonderfully. It is a pure white color (whipped cream). It didnt go on super light, nor did it go on to thick, one coat is enough, but I used 2. Another plus is the bottle is MUCH bigger than I expected, its like twice the size of the gelish ones. Shipping was also very fast, will order again.

  AFTER: It made my hair crunchy and dry. I guess it's just my hair texture, and I have 4C hair, but it made it crunchy. Maybe you're only supposed to use it on the scalp, because I used it on the length of my hair. I will keep buying it, because it is a good moisturizer for dry lips and skin, but does not do anything for my hair and makes my scalp itchy.

  AFTER: This product is a great deal for the price.  I believe it works as well as much more expensive department store products that make the same claims.  I have sensitive skin and rosacea, so was pleased when I found something that doesn't irritate my skin.

  AFTER: Yep, that's what it does - dries hair. It's not horrible (especially for the price), but there's nothing special about it either. Pay no attention to the claim that it makes your hair shinier, because it doesn't. It didn't add volume, either. However, when I purchased this, I didn't expect either of the claims to hold up - I bought it to dry my hair, and it did...I purchased this in 2010, and had to toss it in the middle of 2013 because the cord started sparking when I plugged it in. I like hair dryers that get hot, but not *that* hot... so in the trash it went. That said, lasting 2 1/2 years at the price I paid is okay with me.

I was told a lot of good things about what this could do for my hair but I haven't seen anything differently happen in comparison to me using my other hair oils. It was also more expensive than the regular oil for less product.

  AFTER: The heat and cool air is wonderful, I like the cold blast button. There's an indicator light for the ions working like they should. It's attractive in color and style, as far as blow dryers are concerned. It comes with a point attachment and a diffuser. It has three temperatures and the cold blast. The air flow is sufficient, and the heat is not too hot so it burns but hot enough it dries quickly. I've noticed a lot less frizz in my curly hair and my best friend borrowed it and she has super fine straight hair and had it blow dry smooth without any static when she borrowed it.If I had but one complaint, and it's really a minor one: the product 'feels' cheap. i worry a little bit that it's not going to be sturdy over the long haul if I drop it or knock it around.Other than that, I like how it looks, it's light enough it's easy to hold, and I like how it works. I'd definitely recommend it, but I also recommend treating it carefully, because it does look like it won't take a beating very well. if you travel a lot of are hard on appliances like this, you might want to find one a bit 'sturdier' feeling.But I think you'll be pleased with how it does your hair and it's worth the price.

  AFTER: I've been using it since 2009 and nothing could replace it. I still like it over some other brands I tried lately, but I started looking again because this cream seem to have a lot more silicon in it now. I usually use BB cream or foundation over it, now I could hardly get the cream absorbed enough even after 10 minutes. I really hope Olay would stick to the original formula! I'd give it a 5 star if there is not that much silicon.

My skin felt clean and refreshed. I used it in the shower, and it made the bathroom smell so good!I love that this soap has natural ingredients, making it great for your skin.

  AFTER: After one use on my acne scars they're 75% better. I use it with lavender oil for pain reduction and skin/scar repair. I use it on my stretch marks and they are better after only two uses. However, this is tramendously painful on non fatty tissues. But before too long--as with epilating--the endorphins kick in and the pain seems to magically fade away. I can here the needles sinking into my facial skin &#34;pop pop&#34;. I can see the blood spots after too. I use it at night to make good use of the nocturnal healing process.

I am not a fan of the scent.On recommendations of friends I tried the skin cream again, and within a week I found my skin breaking out at my chin line. I have not had issues with my skin since I was a teenager, some 50 odd years ago. I was aghast. I stopped using the cream, and my skin cleared within a few days.I must add that my daughter uses Olay Regenerist Cream, and she loves it. So, who knows what the problem is with my use.

  AFTER: i haven't used any needle roller before and I did try it once, I don't think I even punctured my skin, I was barely touching it on my face and it was a little too much for me, but I am a sissy with pain. So I ordered the 0.5mm size and that one I can tolerate and do properly. Just remember to clean face and hands good, always use clean/disinfected roller. I just used the bleach and water solution and soak it for 10 mins, but just bought some alcohol and will be using the alcohol to disinfect it a little.When rolling, roll in one direction, someone recommended to just roll once direction, then lift and roll again. I did try that roll once, but now I get the hang of it, I can roll on the same area without moving the roller to much, repeat 8-10 tiems. When you move the roller while rolling it can potentially cut your face so please be careful. You will notice your face turning red and some areas where its not too red, then I just go over that area with a roller again. I had been doing this for 2 weeks now so haven't really noticed a significant change. But I can tell that when I applied the Hyaluronic with C & E, it really gets soaked up right away and my skin is softer. Also I was doing the peel and had noticed some chages on my pores, getting smaller, yeeey! So I really dont know whats working, but Im sure its the combination of Peel, Roller and Hyaluronic acid.

  AFTER: I give this 5 stars due to the things I consider extremely important in a gel polish.#1 is opacity. This polish took 2 coats to be opaque. That's wonderful!#2 is application. This polish applied wonderfully. Not streaky or too runny. Didn't pool in the cuticle area.#3 is shrink back. This polish has ZERO shrink back. As long as you cap the free edge as usual, there's no shrinking issues.#4 is price. You can't beat the price of IBD Just Gel polishes. They are all very reasonably priced.#5 is lasting power. This polish lasted 2 weeks and 4 days, zero chipping, cracking or peeling. Its looked flawless for the entire manicure.Black lava will now be my go to black gel Polish. Its simply black, no shimmer or frost. Its better than some of the expensive black gels I've tried and lasts way longer and applies better. Also the brush is in my opinion one of the best. Not too big, not too small. Doesn't make a mess of my cuticles :)

I can definitely say I see a difference in my skin on the treated hand. It's not anything a stranger would comment on randomly or anything... but it's noticeable to me. The skin is a bit thicker and smoother, and the veins don't stand out as much. It's not a miracle worker, but it is definitely making a difference. My skin on my face seems healthier and brighter when I've been using it. It's a definite keeper!

It might work for others but I personally can not see myself doing this on a regular basis, I mean you are poking your face with hundreds of small needles. It made my face itchy and uncomfortable days after using it I also workout on a regular basis and sweating made me nervous of possible infection.You have to be committed to used this product I certainly can not poke my face regularly even though I thought I would.

I honestly didn't find a con to this soap at all, I did notice a few pimples that popped up a day or so after use but I would have to say that is probably due to the salt pulling the impurities out of my skin. I will continue to use this bar of soap and update my blog review once the bar is used up! I have super sensitive skin so knowing I didn't have an allergic reaction to this wonderful soap just makes me love it even more.

  AFTER: WOW LOVE THIS HAIR DRYER. I called my stylist and asked her which is the best and gave her a couple choices.  She said Tourmaline Ionic Dryer. You can't beat this hair dryer and as one review from a stylist said she loves it and it is affordable vs. hundreds of $$$'s for the same thing that stylists use.  I use it with a Tourmaline Brush and I have curly hair which frizzes especially at the ends.  The tools it comes with like the finger styler and the round attachment for curly hair and a great dryer for this price is a great buy and I'm glad that it is affordable because not everyone can afford what they need. I'm grateful for the deal I got the day I purchased.  If I don't use my brush iron and wish to only use the dryer and my special brush then all I have to do is put a little pure argan oil on the ends and it smooths out the little friz on the ends.  Should I go curly the attachment is awesome. Helps to make the curls a nice style.  Shipping was on schedule and I'm a very happy customer. Almost forgot to add that you do get more shine as well. 100% happy.

  AFTER: The Mineral soap arrived in great condition, in a cute little box.  It is about the size of a regular bar of soap.  My mom was here the day it came, and she said that it smells like ivory.  I thought it just had a strong, soap smell.  I know, imagine that, the soap smells like soap :-).  There is no perfume or fruity like smells, (which, really is to be expected from an all natural soap) and it was very strong. However,  During a shower, the smell is not that strong, and I really like how it smells on your skin.My husband is a carpenter, so he is around dust, dirt, and is sweating for a good part of his day.  I thought he would benefit from this the most. It has been a few days now, and I can feel a difference in my skin, as well as see a difference in my husbands.  His pores on his face and back do not look as clogged and yucky like they usually do,  he scrubs them twice daily, before the new Mineral Soap, and now, with it.  The new soap has clearly made a difference!  You can feel a tightening in the skin almost immediately, before even getting out of the shower. Soap DOES lather on a wash cloth! The bar seems to be lasting a decent amount of time. We have used it quite a bit and there is plenty left! I would most definitely buy this soap in the future, as well as recommend to everyone!

  AFTER: I actually really liked this hair dryer while it worked. It dried my hair relatively quickly. It also came with both a concentrating nozzle to make my hair straighten nicely and with a diffuser that worked really well at drying my hair on cold days that I wanted to leave it curly. While the dryer works, it works well.It started giving me trouble almost exactly one year after I purchased it, right when the warranty ends. It started by sparking once or twice as I was drying my hair. Then it began to stop blowing at random intervals until I tilted the hairdryer in different directions. It wasn't the plug - trying this at different outlets yielded the same result. This was annoying, but it seemed that if I pointed the dryer in a certain direction and didn't move, it would continue to blow. Then, finally, it got so bad that drying my hair was impossible - the blow dryer was stopping more than it was blowing. I expected it to last for longer than a year, so overall, the purchase was a disappointment.

I just mixed it with my almond oil and diluted it with some water and generously applied it to my roots and ends and the next day my hair was nice and soft. I haven't seen any growth yet but I'm sure I will.I recommend this to those who are transitioning to natural hair.

  AFTER: This is my second favorite mascara after max factor 2000.  As the product says, you get no clumps, and I like the fact that it comes in brown shades.  While this lasts on your eyes longer than max factor, it's not as build-able, so you get less dramatic eyelashes.  If you are just looking for a little emphasis and no-fuss mascara (for work for example), but don't need super big lashes, this would be a good product for you.

  AFTER: I am impressed. On a news program I heard about the new Ionic hair dryers. I already had a Revlon Ionic hair dryer, but it was several years old, and worked just fine, but the price of this one was so reasonable I thought I would give it a try. Well what they said about the new ones was correct. This really does dry your hair in half the time. It is better for your hair, as it dries your hair with less heat! Not sure how that works, but it does. Highly recommend this product!

  AFTER: it shipped fast, and was as promised.  i love that it's lightweight and can dry my thick, curly, long hair in about 10 mins (which is about 20 mins faster than my last blow dryer) without causing frizzies (when using the diffuser, which was included, along with a concentrator) or my arms needing a break.  the only time i've had my hair dried faster was at Gene Juarez with what i'm assuming is much more expensive equipment.  for under $30 i can live with the toggle buttons where they are.  i turned it off once by accident, and just repositioned my hand after that and it was not an issue.

But, it did improve my skin the next morning when used at night time.Good results for the price but I hope it was more midly scented..

  AFTER: This soap helps to defeat dry skin!  I love this soap and cannot say enough good things about it.  It smells great and rinses clean with no film or residue. It also gently exfoliates your skin.  I started using it on my face but when I saw how much better my skin looked started using it on my whole body.  Let me give you some back story about my skin, it is a dry, flaky, rashy, hot mess.  So when I first tried this soap I wasn't expecting much. After using in once, I noticed the skin on my face wasn't tight feeling like it is when I use my normal soap.  My face was soft and smooth.  So I tried it on the rest of my body, and what a difference it has made! I now longer have to apply lotion continuously all day long. Once and I'm good to go!  Also, I'm not trying to make any health claims or anything.  It could just be coincidence but after using this soap for a week, the eczema on my arms ( that has been there for years) has cleared considerably, and my skin is no longer painfully dry.  If you have skin issues, give this soap a try and see how it works for you. For me it has really made a difference! Thanks Adovia!

  AFTER: It seems to me that Amazon is a really great place to buy daily skin products like Aveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Lotion because these products are in many cases much cheaper than the average chain pharmacy (like Duane Reade or CVS in NYC). In addition, there are often deals like a package of 3 that can be cheaper still. So that's my plug for Amazon. As for this product, I have used it for years. I apply it to my body after every shower and I love the way my skin feels after application. If I do not apply it, my skin feels and looks taut, dry and sometimes scaly after Aveeno my skin feels smooth, soft and supple. In the summer I like to use self-tanner moisturizers so I get the opportunity to compare several other brands that purport to be moisturizing and there is no comparison with Aveeno. There are probably other good body moisturizers out there but I am not looking because I am very satisfied with the results I get with Aveeno.

I use it every other day after a thorough face and neck cleansing and prior to applying evening products.  It does not hurt if used properly and does open your skin to be more receptive to your toners, vitamin applications and moisturizers.  Try one, I believe you will be pleased with it.  I am.

  AFTER: As a fair-skinned lifelong Florida resident, former sun worshiper, and wife of someone who has had melanomas removed several times, I take protecting my skin from the sun fairly seriously.  Not just when I'm going to be out in the sun for extended periods of time, but even during a normal day when I'm only exposed to the sun while walking between buildings and cars.  Those rays really do affect the skin, even in small doses.  Because of that, a couple of years ago I started using a lotion with SPF 15 each and every day.  When I'm going to be out working in the yard or doing some activity that will mean longer exposure I'll use a stronger suntan lotion, but for the usual routine I think  SPF 15 is enough.But just because I want skin protection doesn't mean I want to smell like suntan lotion or feel like I've slathered myself with some kind of greasy goo.  The usual suntan lotions were not something I would be able to make myself use everyday so I went in search of a regular body lotion with SPF protection.  In the past I was using a Eucerin lotion and that wasn't too bad.  But it still had a little bit of a suntan-lotion-type of smell and felt a little weird on my skin so when the bottle started to run low I looked around for another brand to try.  I ordered this Aveeno lotion based on the reviews and ingredients.Well, I have to say the Eucerin is out and the Aveeno is in!  Very, very minimal fragrance that is nothing like suntan lotion, and it feels like normal body lotion on my skin.  The price is great and the 12 oz bottle is a generous size.  I'll probably order the larger size when I run out, I just wanted to start with something smaller to see if I liked it.  Now I just have to get the last bit of Eucerin out of the bottle (don't you hate it when the pump won't suck up the last inch of product in the bottom of the bottle?) and then I can switch to Aveeno full time.Oh - since I started using lotion every day my skin has been much softer, smoother, and generally looks and feels better and healthier.  My dermatologist is impressed. I can't give Aveeno or Eucerin credit for that, though, since I also use another brand's non-SPF lotion at night.  It's just a general statement for those who are lax on using a body lotion daily.  It's easy to forget to take care of the skin, especially the arms and legs, but it really does pay to keep it soft.Anyway, I do recommend the Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion with SPF 15.

  AFTER: I have a dry skin and a little bit sensitive, but this bottle really surprises me. It can really moisture my sensitive without feeling greasy, and it won&#8217;t leave any stains on the pillow. It just makes me feel so tight, soft and smooth.I also have some lines, but this one just feels like plumping up my skin, now my lines are slighter then before. Besides this moisturizer is in reasonable price, but come with amazing result, highly recommended to others.But just to be fair, I don&#8217;t like the smell, but I would give it a 5 stars.

  AFTER: I don't think there's really much to say about a hair dryer, except that this one works well as far as drying hair. I don't really see any amazing ion effect, so I can't give it props in that area. I also think that the diffuser is a little strange being flat. It's kinda hard to get your hair to stay on it. A cupped diffuser is better. Overall, it's okay as far as a unit that will dry your hair, but don't expect anything else but that. It is lightweight, so I gave it 3 stars for living up to that description.

  AFTER: OK I have always been a product junkie, spending too much on creams and lotions of all sorts. Never thought to use something as simple as an oil. I feel like I have just come across a gold mine! I initially purchased the product for my man once I read about its benefits in reversing baldness. As I researched a little more, I found many more advantages such as longer and thicker lashes and brows, tightening and softening skin, eliminating wrinkles and stretch marks, removing callouses and warts and other fungal infections, treating acne, shinier healthier hair....etc. So far I have only used it for a couple of days, and I am already blown away. The softening effect on my skin is nothing like I have ever experienced. Never again will I spend money on expensive face creams. Granted, the oil is a little on the thick side, so a little goes a long way. But if you put a couple of dabs around the eyes and massage them on your wrinkles before bed and very little before you go out, you will see the effects almost immediately! I also bought almond oil (since now I am believer in the miraculous powers of oil) just to mix it with since it has a much lighter consistency, and also high benefits to the skin.Another amazing effect is on my callouses on the soles of my feet, as I run a lot. Absolutely better than any foot cream I've ever used. I massage it in nightly and wear socks right before bed. Instant gratification! Been using it on my stretch marks too around my butt, and I already see changes!All I can say is stop spending money on name brands and go for the source. You will not be disappointed!

I'd give it a 5 star if there is not that much silicon.

No flaking all day and my lashes are as soft as if I were not wearing mascara. A great product, and I find other mascaras to be a compromise. Good stuff,!

  AFTER: 1/31/13 UPDATE: I have been using this mascara in Very Black (rather than Brown) and I have upgraded my opinion from 4 to 5 Stars. This is a very good, well priced, every day mascara that is easy to apply, dries quickly and gives one's lashes moderate volume and length.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I am quite specific in my mascara preferences and I usually don't care for curved brushes. This brush, however is excellent. Shaped like a smile or a wedge (thicker in the center and tapered at the ends), the brush is composed of many short plastic spikes that move easily through the lashes while depositing lots of pigment at the lash roots. The shape of the brush allows for quick and even application even at the more difficult to reach areas: the inner and outer corners, the lower lashes. It is because of this innovative brush that I would recommend this mascara overCoverGirl Lashblast Mascara, Very Black 800, which is a very good, everyday product.This  mascara is smooth and somewhat glossy in Brown and matte in Very Black. It applies evenly without much clumping as long as you kept the brush moving. "Build-ability", the ability to apply multiple coats one over the other was not a problem as long as the mascara had not dried fully. Once dried, the mascara would clump somewhat when a fresh coat was applied.....not terrible but not exactly what I would call a "Clump Crusher" either. My current favorite "dime store" mascara isL'Oreal Paris Voluminous Million Lashes Mascara, Blackest Blackand I can apply it in the morning before work and then at 7 pm reapply a coat for a more dramatic effect before going out to dinner. You also can do this with "Clump Crusher", but not with the same voluminous effect.This mascara comes in four shades: Very Black, Black, Black Brown, and Brown. I originally tested the Brown which I found to be extremely, surprisingly light in color, even lighter than my normal lashes. I would only recommend the Brown for extremely fair, light blondes or perhaps strawberry blondes with pale, pale lashes who are interested in a casual, natural look. Otherwise, for anyone else, I would not go lighter than the Black Brown.This mascara is an excellent choice if you are interested in natural looking lashes with moderate volume and length.

I have taken weeks off from rolling, so in reality I probably only used this thing for 4-6 weeks on a very consistent basis. just recently, after breaking, i saw that an 18 year old scar that was under my eye is gone. if i can post pics as proof i would. i was shocked that i didn't notice this sooner.i target treated this specific area. i was targeting my worry lines also but my forehead became so dry and waxy looking. although i was moisturizing the area the extreme dryness was essentially accentuating my worry lines and so i stopped targeting that area. i may start once again now that my scar is gone.i will update if i see more changes.

  AFTER: I received a free product to review for my blog, and I am never disappointed by Adovia.I have been using this soap all over for a few weeks now, and I have nothing but good to say about it. It cleans without stripping natural oils, and it keeps me from being all stinky- hey in Arizona you have to watch that in summer;)I love the light scent of this product, and all of Adovia's products really.. it is fresh and clean smelling without being overwhelming or too girly. Just the right scent.I am still using their shampoo and conditioner, so it is a great complement for all 3 together.Thanks again to Adovia for a great product!

  AFTER: I love this soap, yea I already love dead sea salt & how softening, moisturizing & just great for skin health it is, so adding it into a bar of soap for me makes it perfect. This soap is smooth & is not at all gritty when using it, not harsh & has a mild scent, the scent does not bother me but might bother others. This soap is great to use for general skin health but is also great for skin issues such as eczema, rough dry skin, psoriasis, hives, rashes acne & more. What I tend to hate about even natural soaps is they leave behind a residue especially if they have any kind of salt in them, this soap not only does not leave behind any residue it rinses off very easily & leaves your skin feeling amazing.You have got to love a soap that is natural, healing, soothing & has soap magnesium, potassium, sodium, zinc & more for a total of 21 minerals needed for skin health & body health. Feel the rich lather that makes you feel like you are not using soap at all, then feel how great it makes your skin feel & look & how others are noticing the great results.Thank you to Adovia for making all these great skin care products, I love what I have tried so far,great company with great communication that really cares about the customers & that is important when buying online.

  AFTER: I tried this as well as the regular castor oil, I love them both but would probably prefer this one over the other one. This one cost a couple of dollars more but it works better in my opinion. I have natural hair and my edges were thinning from a hairstyle that I had that was too tight, this grew my edges back almost completely in 45 days, I could see some growth after 2 days. I also put this on my eyebrows for fullness and have friends that rub a little on their eyelashes. I had no problems with shedding like I have read in other reviews. This is my 3 bottle that I have ordered. The only slight problem I had was a small amount of leakage when shipped.

  AFTER: I was lucky to get to try out the Adovia Moisturizing Mineral Soap. I love the smell of it as well as the way it leaves my skin smooth and moisturized. I honestly didn't find a con to this soap at all, I did notice a few pimples that popped up a day or so after use but I would have to say that is probably due to the salt pulling the impurities out of my skin. I will continue to use this bar of soap and update my blog review once the bar is used up! I have super sensitive skin so knowing I didn't have an allergic reaction to this wonderful soap just makes me love it even more.

  AFTER: Castor Oil is great for the scalp and that is why I purchased it. I love to put a tad bit of oil on my scalp right after the shower to relieve my dry itchy scalp. It also softens the hair, and gets rid of dandruff (or itchy scalp). Castor Oil is also good on dry skin.

It doesn't extend your lashes, it just makes them look like perfect eyelashes that dolls do!  I look the shape of the applicator and how easy it is to apply.  It goes on SUPER SMOOTH and you can double coat without waiting!  Lasts ALL DAY LONG.  Not waterproof, but doesn't flake or smear.  I have slept in this stuff and woke up with PERFECT LASHES!!!!

  AFTER: I do not know if it works or not because my hair has not grown but I have not used it on a regular basis but what I hate about this product is the smell, they should add fragrance in it or something. It makes your hair smell like fried chicken grease and it absolutely awful. I may try to pair it with a conditioner or something to alleviate the problem and will update my review after I do but if you are interested in using this product by itself it may not be the best idea unless you like walking around smelling like a deep fryer,which even using the smallest amount will make you smell like that.

I have Gelish brand and I wasn't sure how this IBD Just Gel brand would have worked.  My nails turned out perfect and I paid half of the price then what I would with Gelish.

I have been using this for abut a month but lately I have noticed it has been peeling off my nails much faster than the prior 2 weeks I would get out of it.

  AFTER: I have bought ionized dryers before with little success, however this one definitely lives up to its claims.

  AFTER: I use this on my face for acne (which has really worked) as well as replacing my moisturizer and on my hair for softness (which has also worked.) I've been using on my face everyday for two weeks and my hair 1-2 times per week during that span. It looks like hardly any is missing from the bottle--so a little bit goes a LONG way! For the price offered here, you really can't go wrong. I imagine this will last at least 3-4 months.

  AFTER: This is one of the nicest all natural soaps I&#8217;ve come across. Its first two ingredients are natural oils known for their moisturizing properties and does not contain any actual soap. No harsh chemicals to counteract the good and no extra fillers to cheapen the product.As I already mentioned, my skin tends to be very dry and itchy and it wasn&#8217;t until I began using Adovia Natural Dead Sea Mud Soap that I finally had an epiphany about the ingredients in soap. This soap, the moisturizing soap, doesn&#8217;t have loads of lather either because all of its ingredients are natural. No sodium lauryl sulfate! Sodium lauryl sulfate is the ingredient in soaps, shampoos and household cleansers (!) that cause them to lather up, and its dangers are well known.* I&#8217;m extraordinarily sensitive to sodium lauryl sulfate in oral care products. It makes my tongue and gums burn so badly that before I was clued in by a doctor I could only eat or drink items that were at room temperature. I was in misery. Why did it take so long for me to realize that it could be affecting my skin? I love Adovia&#8217;s mud soap for my body but this moisturizing formula is perfect for the more sensitive skin of my face.Adovia Moisturizing Dead Sea Salt Soap has a lovely light scent that doesn&#8217;t linger and that&#8217;s another huge bonus in my book. My skin feels clean, not tight, moisturized, not greasy, and soft not rough and uneven. I follow up with Adovia Dead Sea Salt Facial Serum and love the way my skin feels these days.

  AFTER: I've been dealing with a crazy itchy scalp, so I finally shaved my head to get to the root of the problem.  I just massage some of this JBCO on my head and it keeps it moisturized through out the day.  It's kinda thick which is nice because I don't want it to absorb into the wigs I wear.  I'm gonna keep trying it. A friend said that I should mix it with some shea butter along with tea tree oil and that should sooth my scalp as well.  I will probably buy again.

  AFTER: I have been using JBCO since February 2012. I really like doing my three times a week scalp massage with this stuff. I mix it with another oil (e.g. jojoba or Vitamin E) because it is kind of thick and doesn't spread as well as I want it to on it's own.My hair grows fast, but I think that this product has given my thickness a boost. I know women who swear by it, but I encourage people to use it to see if it works for them!

  AFTER: I give this 5 stars due to the things I consider extremely important in a gel polish.#1 is opacity. This polish took 2 coats to be opaque. That's wonderful!#2 is application. This polish applied wonderfully. Not streaky or too runny. Didn't pool in the cuticle area.#3 is shrink back. This polish has ZERO shrink back. As long as you cap the free edge as usual, there's no shrinking issues.#4 is price. You can't beat the price of IBD Just Gel polishes. They are all very reasonably priced.#5 is lasting power. This polish lasted 2 weeks and 4 days, zero chipping, cracking or peeling. Its looked flawless for the entire manicure.Black lava will now be my go to black gel Polish. Its simply black, no shimmer or frost. Its better than some of the expensive black gels I've tried and lasts way longer and applies better. Also the brush is in my opinion one of the best. Not too big, not too small. Doesn't make a mess of my cuticles :)

  AFTER: This soap helps to defeat dry skin!  I love this soap and cannot say enough good things about it.  It smells great and rinses clean with no film or residue. It also gently exfoliates your skin.  I started using it on my face but when I saw how much better my skin looked started using it on my whole body.  Let me give you some back story about my skin, it is a dry, flaky, rashy, hot mess.  So when I first tried this soap I wasn't expecting much. After using in once, I noticed the skin on my face wasn't tight feeling like it is when I use my normal soap.  My face was soft and smooth.  So I tried it on the rest of my body, and what a difference it has made! I now longer have to apply lotion continuously all day long. Once and I'm good to go!  Also, I'm not trying to make any health claims or anything.  It could just be coincidence but after using this soap for a week, the eczema on my arms ( that has been there for years) has cleared considerably, and my skin is no longer painfully dry.  If you have skin issues, give this soap a try and see how it works for you. For me it has really made a difference! Thanks Adovia!

  AFTER: This is a beautiful coral salmon color. It has tiny, tiny blue glitter that can only really be seen in very bright light, but adds a wonderful glimmer.I used three coats, though I probably would have been fine with two. It lasted for two weeks in almost perfect condition before I wanted to change to a new color. I mixed it with Gelish &#34;Foundation Base&#34; and &#34;Top It Off&#34; with no problems.It goes on very smooth. It was the first color I used for my DIY gel nails and I couldn't believe how perfect it looked and felt. IBD's color options and prices are fantastic. I haven't been disappointed yet.

  AFTER: I bought this Castor Oil strictly for any hair and skin benefits.  I do not have any scars, or stretch marks to test it on, but I can comment on any hair/scalp and skin benefits.My Hair condition:  Dry, course textured, thick, and color treated hair, (frizzy hair in both humid and dry climates) about an inch longer than shoulder length, with a small patch of itchy dry psoriasis in the back of my head.Facial Condition:  Dry skin, and since moving to the Southwest Desert, a very dry and acrid climate ...even drier skin.  I have reached my sixties, so with age; my skin has become challenging dry.Hair ChallengeMy first test object was my hair and scalp.  I decided not to brush my hair for the very first time ever, before shampooing.  I mixed 1/8 tsp. of castor oil in with a handful of my regular shampoo and lathered up.  I did not think that this could possibly be enough, but according to the other reviews that I had read, "a little tiny bit was supposed to go a long, long way."  My hair lathered up nicely, and then I rinsed.  I noticed four things immediately.1) Lose fall-out hairs were minimal - even though I did not brush my hair out first.2) That small patch of psoriasis was soothed - even though I did not use the medicated shampoo.3) No mats or tangles - even though I skipped the conditioner.4) My wet hair felt good, not slimy, not greasy, not oily, just a healthy hair feeling.I skipped my usual leave-in conditioner, and proceeded directly to the blow drier.Results:My hair dried a little faster than usual, and was incredibly soft, soft like a kitten or a puppy's fur.  My hairstyle finish was not quite as smooth or defined as I prefer, it came out a little too fluffy, but with the addition of a few spritzes of argon oil, the results were perfect.  Another bonus for me was that there were very few hairs left on my roll brush, only 4, or 5, which means that there was no hair breakage.  I usually pull an awful lot more hair off my roll brush when I am finished with the blow dry.  The final positive result was when I was out in the sunlight, my hair had a bit of a healthy, clean shine.  This is unusual for my hair because a thick, course textured head of hair does not generally have that characteristic, only my hairdresser can perform this miracle.Facial Challenge:As I have mentioned earlier in this review, I have very dry skin.  I applied a small amount of the castor oil on my face in the evening.  It is thick, and it is greasy, but this is what my dry skin requires because within an hour or so, the castor oil was completely absorbed.  I decided to lightly coat my face once more before bed.  In the morning, my face was a little dry, not sandpaper dry, as I have experienced in the past, but not that soft suppleness that I was hoping to achieve.  However, my skin texture and color was better and a little more even toned!In the other areas of my face that I have used this oil, I have seen some improvement.  My eyebrows are a little thicker, my lashes are luscious, and where I have been applying the oil nightly around the front fringes of my temple, there seems to be some thickening in some areas.  The little peach fuzz hairs around my hairline have not uniformly thickened in all areas, but I have not been using the oil for that long, and I have noticed that different areas respond at different time rates.  However, whatever improvement that been achieved has completely satisfied what little expectations that I have had in this area.I hope that my review has helped those who share my dry skin, facial, and hair issues.

  AFTER: After trying out the soap for myself I love the way my skin feels after; my skin feels clean, soft and hydrated. It doesn&#8217;t leave your skin feeling dry or scratchy but left my skin feeling smooth and soft. Not to mention I think the soap smells so good and fresh! It&#8217;s just one of those fresh scents that can truly be appreciated when you smell it. Also, I noticed that this soap doesn&#8217;t give the residue after effect that a lot of infused soaps do, which is a huge plus to me. I hate that residue after affect and avoid those soaps at all cost to be honest. Something else I noticed when I used this soap is that the exfoliation benefits are tremendous and instantly noticeable. I&#8217;m one who appreciates instant gratification so to see an immediately noticeable difference is again, a big deal for me. The one major thing though that really caught my attention about this soap is that the bar is solid. What I mean by that is that other moisturizing bars disintegrate whereas this bar is holding up well in the shower and so far not dissolving.Needless to say I&#8217;ve had a positive experience using the Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap bar. It works great, it&#8217;s high quality, and feels great! It&#8217;s also supposed to be good on sensitive skin as well, but I&#8217;m not so sensitive so I can&#8217;t vouch for that one. Not to mention it smells good. I definitely recommend the soap.

Makeup goes on well over it.  Love the smell and texture.  Some days I can feel my skin say, &#34;thanks&#34;, after putting it on.

  AFTER: This is the first time I have ever tried a Natural soap and I absolutely love it!!It has a really nice, crisp fresh scent to it, lathers really nicely, actually feels really silky in my hands and it is 100 % natural which makes me feel that i am doing something good for my skin. Harsh chemicals in other soaps tend to make my skin feel really dry and itchy and then i end up piling on lotions which also contain certain chemicals as well.Did you know that some lotions actually contain alcohol? not to mention dyes and other harmful chemicals. Crazy huh? But getting back to this soap...here are just a few things that i find awesome about this wonderful product:It is Infused with 100% Pure Dead Sea Salts from the Dead SeaDead Sea Salt Contains over 21 Minerals Key to Skin Health and BeautyDeeply Moisturizing and Hydrating Soap great for Dry and Normal to Dry SkinDead Sea Minerals Essential to Skin Function Contained in the Soap Include Magnesium, Potassium, Sodium, Zinc and More.Great Value and Benefits for A Daily Moisturizing Facial Cleanser!!!After using this the first time my face feels really clean and fresh...almost don't want to apply my makeup LOL...just feels really good, soft and radiant.If you are looking for a high quality soap that the whole family can use...or just to treat yourself to some well deserved pampering...i suggest getting some :) Your face and body will feel so much nicer and you will not want to go back to using those harshful chemical filled soaps ever again.

  AFTER: I guess you can call me a mascara junkie in that I like to try different brands and don't usually stick to one brand for too long.  I also try never to spend more than $10. on any mascara--the way I see it either the mascara works or it doesn't in terms of easy application, longer and thicker lashes, low or no clumpiness.  This mascara fits the bill in all those important respects and sells at a good price.  I have already ordered a second tube, that's how much I like it, I don't want to run out of it.  I give it a "4" though because I don't think it is hypoallergenic, plus it is marked as being made in Korea....I don't know what the standards are for makeup in other countries.Several months later, I found that every time I wore this mascara my eyes would have a burning sensation which I never had with other mascaras.  Sure enough, I switched to other mascaras and the burning sensation stopped.  Nervous about the ingredients now so wouldn't use it again.

  AFTER: I've been using a Vidal Sassoon travel hair dryer for years and it was time to replace it.  I started looking at more expensive brands and was about to pay $139 on a light weight Sedu.  I asked my hairdresser for recommendations and she actually told me to save my money and buy a drug store brand.  After reading all of the reviews on Amazon, I settled on the Revlon RV544.  It's bigger than my travel hair dryer but it's about the same weight and it's a lot more powerful.  I've only used it a few times but I like it.  Unlike some reviewers, I don't find the buttons poorly placed and I think the cord is a good length.  Bottom line, you can't beat the Revlon RV544 for the price.UPDATE:  I've changed my mind about this blow dryer.  I have a lot of fine, layered hair. The blow dryer doesn't give my hair body.  I thought my hair was looking flat because I was in need of a hair cut.  Then I used a blow dryer at my gym and my hair looked fine.  I realized that it's not my hair, it's the dryer.NEW BOTTOM LINE:  Based on the positive reviews, I think this hair dryer is good for people with thick or curly or frizzy hair.  I can't recommend it for people with fine hair.

  AFTER: I have only used this twice, but wow!!! I had a tummy tuck 6 years ago. I still like to wear a bikini, but I have a long brown bumpy scar. (I was allergic to the stiches they used and my scar bubbled up and didn't heal nice and smooth.)I had been trying hydroquine 4% cream the derm. gave my for my pregnancy mask off and on on it, but it didn't really do anything. I read about the 1mm derma roller and thought I'd give it a try. I don't have a lot of feeling on my scar, so I was able to real "go at it" without any nubbing cream. I wasn't overly harsh, but I can see where I pierced the skin. Once everything was rolled, I looked really sunburnt and had a few flecks of blood. THEN I rubbed the hydroquine cream on top. The next day neither my hubby or I could believe it! It was a tad lighter BUT SMOOTH, NOT BUMPY! I was thinking, maybe everything was just puffy so I waited. A week later, my scar is still smooth!I just did the derma roller again this morning on my scar. More to try to get the cream in it to lighten it some more. There's not too much more to smooth out, so that doesn't bother me. I just can't stop rubbing my fingers over the scar!!!I did do my face the first time when I did my scar w/o any nubbing cream. It is do-able. I did find myself beathing very deeply and concentrating, almost as I did with my contractions when in labor. My face felt sunburnt for the night and tight the next morning. I am going to do it again, but my new serum is on the way, so I am waiting for that and I read you shouldn't do it too often because you don't want to destroy the collagen you are trying to build up. So far, I have nothing but good things to say about the derma roller!

  AFTER: I'm a fan of Cover Girl products because they work well and aren't overly expensive.  This mascara doesn't disappoint - it goes on smoothly with the brush and doesn't clump on my lashes.  I like that it colors and defines my lashes without thickening them too much, since I'm a little too old to pull off a dramatic super-huge-eyelash look.This mascara stays on all day without flaking or ending up smeared under my eyes, and it washes off easily with soap and water or cold cream.My only complaint is the odd shape of the container.  It's small on one end and top heavy so it wants to fall over, and angled at the other end so it can't stand on that end either.  And it's too fat in diameter to fit in the openings of my makeup case.  I do like the bright green color, since that makes it easy to find in a purse.

  AFTER: I really like the IBD products because they are good quality, great price, and the bottles are much larger than their more expensive counterparts.But after using this basecoat, my daughter and I both discovered that the polish started peeling off after about 5 days.  My daughter used it first and I thought she just had "oily nails", but when I finally used it, the same thing happened.  The top coat and polish are okay because I'd used them many times; it's just the basecoat.

  AFTER: This light weight dryer dries my hair quickly without frying it due to the Warm setting on high.  I've been buying Tourmaline / Ionic dryers for years and would not consider buying any other.  It's quieter than my other dryers too.  I like the defuser for days when I want to go with my natural curly look without having to wait for it to air dry.  It's a steal on Amazon compared to my $100 dryers that do the same thing.  I was intending on leaving this one at my son's home when I visit him, but after using it I brought it back home with me and will leave another of my high priced dryers there the next time I visit.

  AFTER: So... we have a lot of different mascaras but you buy the one you believe will help you achieve the looks you want. With this mascara specifically you get a lot of presicion, and coming from me thats a lot to say(always need to rescue my makeup with Q-tips because I simply can't apply the mascara without a mess cuz my hands shake a lot), I couldnt believe how easy was to apply it on my lower eye lashes and no clumps either, cant say is the best one I've ever used but its pretty good.... The bad part about this type of brush is you cannot roll it over into your eyelashes but I guess this one makes it up.

  AFTER: This is one of two products in the world that I really have a hard time living without (the other is q-tip brand cotton swabs). I have bottles by every sink and in my purse and gym bag.I'll admit I am highly picky about hand lotion. This is the only one I love. I put this on and my hands just feel good- they don't feel like lotion is on them or like they are greasy or slippery or heavy or dry (how do some lotions make hands feel dry?! I'll never figure that one out) they just feel like my hands, as perfect as they can be.The product has a very slight scent, but I don't really notice except when I am trying to smell it. I would definitely categorize it as "unscented"It really doesn't do much for heavily damaged areas, like the bottoms of my feet, but then, I wouldn't expect it to. That requires a targeted heavy cream that would feel gross on my hands and body. So that's really the only area I don't use this on. I actually even used this as a facial moisturizer for years (and still do in a pinch), but since I am now in need of wrinkle cream, I don't do that consistently anymore.When I studied abroad in college I did not take any Aveeno. Big mistake. I honestly thought about it every day. So when I was taking a 3-month trip out of the country last year, I prioritized my Aveeno, and even though it meant throwing out clothes at the airport to get my bag to meet weight restrictions, it was worth keeping enough Aveeno to get me through.

  AFTER: Bought this to blend my own formula to use as a facial cleanser - it's called the European facial oil cleanse method. Castor oil acts as an antibacterial agent in the recipe used to combat breakouts. I'm of French ancestors whose women have used the oil method for generations. We always blend our own recipes customized to each ladies needs. Now brand of castor oil is the purest, clearest, and the  cleanest I've found. Its safe for ingesting, too. It's reasonably priced and shipped quickly. Highly recommend NOW oils and this seller.

  AFTER: I try to always be open and kind with all my reviews. Even the ones I don't care about too much. I try to always start on the positive note before I bring in the yuck factor. But there are times when the stars and romance meet in perfect harmony and I just love on something so much I just have to go tell it from the roof tops. Adovia has been that perfect beauty find for me this year. I have had the pleasure of trying several of their products and here is the latest.I recently tried the Adovia Moisturizing Mineral Soap with Dead Sea Salt and Minerals. A soap infused with amazing 100% Pure Dead Sea Salts from the Dead Sea. These salts contains over 21 minerals to deeply hydrate, cleanse and balance your skin. It throughrally cleanses your skin from grim, makeup, sebum and yet never stripping your skin from the vital nutrients and oils it needs. Leaving your skin hydrated, moisturized and feeling healthy. It is truly a perfect moisturizing cleaner for all skin types. Gentle enough for the sensitive of skins and yet balanced for the oiliest of skins.Oh, and did I tell you the smell is beautiful. Its a soft, and clean fragrance. Perfect to start off and end your day with. Truly a favorite.I know your thinking.... its a bar. No rethink that and give it a try. You will be impressed. It will not dry your skin as a traditional bar would. This is a moisturizing bar and it is made to cleanse and hydrate. All you have left is a soft, cleansed, and hydrated face. The bar thing is actually more of a benefit for this product. We are talking take it to the gym, after a day at the beach, on vacation, poolside, and even add it to the guest room this Summer. Since it fits all skin types it will fit all the needs as well.Definitely worth trying. Satisfaction is guaranteed. You have nothing to lose.

My edges are back and thick now and I have natural dark coloured jet black hair and it has help the shine in the hair. yes it is thick and the smell may not be to your liking but at the end of the day your hair will thank you bc hair needs natural ground earth products. ALSO you must eat healthy as well and exercise your hair needs that too. YOU MUST GET THIS.  You will not be disappointed. UPDATE!!! It is has been a year since I started using Black Castrol Oil and I STILL USE IT!!! What an awesome product!! My hair is extremely longer, thicker and healthier.  In the process I tried other products and ummmm no no ... does not compare.  I know people complain about the smell but it doesn't matter it works that is what matters.

It arrived packaged perfectly.ProductThis product at first to me was a dud. I wanted to seal my polish ( Non UV Polish) which I do with my other UV coats. This product DOES NOT work with regular nail polish :(. Then I tried it on my overlay and it was tacky, much more tacky than other brands.It dries at a normal paceThe shine is a great luster shineSuggestions:Remember to use rubbing alcohol once you set the UV coat to remove the excess product build up and to remove the tackiness. Apply a really, really thin layer to get the best results.If you are looking a for a Top coat for your solar nails, natural nails and or overlays without polish this is a great product.If you are looking for a Top coat that will seal and secure ANY Polish..try Gelish or Seche brands.

  AFTER: Let me start by saying that I do not use night creams, and I do not use this product regularly.  I use it as my Winter time  moisturizer when I go out at night.  I don't use it during the day because it doesn't have any SPF.  Therefore, I can't comment on its long term effects.  But I have to say, it does have pretty decent instant effects.  It does plump up my facial lines and wrinkles, and minimizes them better than any other drugstore wrinkle cream I have used so far. (And I have tried several).  I will most likely purchase this again.

I think I might purchase a different brand next time just to see if they are the same. I am not very fond of the smell that it has. It's not very pleasant and it lingers a bit.

The ionic part works well.  My hair is less frizzy and have lot of natural curl so I usually have frizz when I blow dry my hair.  Why I returned it was that it the 2 heat settings were not good for me.  The "warm" was actually hot and the" hot" was way too hot for my fine delicate hair.  Back to the drawing board.

  AFTER: Before purchasing JBCO I researched it for about a year.  WHY OH WHY did it take me so long to purchase?!!!!  This is a must have staple within your head to toe daily beauty regime!  It has a faint peanutty type of smell, but it's nothing that I can't deal with.  When I'm using this on my scalp and hair, whether it's before bed or styling for the day, once I use it, I spray my hair with Palmer's Olive Oil with Vitamin E hair spray because it has a nice clean smell that gives my hair that high gloss sheen all day long.  You will see results with this product so be patient.  Everyone's hair grows at a different pace.  It also depends on how much and how often you apply this product.  I also use it on my eyelashes and around my eyes for my night moisturizer, as well as for blemishes, dry cracked skin, cuts, burns, it is an all purpose beauty secret.  A little goes a long way.  BUY IT, USE IT AND SPREAD THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT IT ~ ENJOY!!!

  AFTER: For several years now I have been buying organic, all-natural lotions, shampoos, and bar soaps.  I was paying over $10 a bottle for Nature's Gate and other brands, but they leave my skin greasy and they don't really absorb, causing me to have to reapply frequently.  I recently tried this product out at work since we buy Aveeno to keep in the bathrooms there, and I was surprised to find it absorb better than Nature's Gate and it has absolutely no smell.  I have very sensitive and very dry skin, and this lotion keeps my skin soft for hours.The true test came when I decided to visit the Skin Deep cosmetics database and compare the numbers.  This lotion was rated a 2, which is pretty low for a non-organic brand, and my Nature's Gate was rated a 4!  I could not believe the number was lower, meaning that it's actually less toxic than the organic brand, according to the database.  I went out and purchased a bottle for myself.  It is pricey, but cheaper than organic and much nicer on my skin.

I have been using it for a few months now , it is a little hard to get used to it in the beginning, because of the tingling sensation , and the needles, but once you get used to it and start to use it properly you will see the results, now i use it about 2-3 times a week, and my skin has a better appearance because of better absorption of the cosmetic product applied, but it has to be used and paired with good quality cosmetics

  AFTER: This is the best hairdryer I've owned!I have long, very thick hair, so I usually only dry my bangs and air-dry the rest; drying and styling my whole head can take more than 30 minutes. This dryer has shortened my drying and styling time to under 10 minutes, fresh out of the shower. It's also lightweight, so my arm doesn't get tired holding it. One thing I wasn't expecting was how great my hair would look and feel afterward; usually, after drying, my hair is coarse and wavy and I have to take a flat iron to it. After using the ionic dryer, my hair is smooth and shiny; no need for the straightener!

  AFTER: I have a hard time getting moisture to stay in my hair, whether it's winter or summer. What I have found that works is sealing with a heavy oil and baggying at night or during the day. I have also changed some of my hair habits, such as using cold water to rinse the conditioner out of my hair and using non-silicone conditioners.

It didnt go on super light, nor did it go on to thick, one coat is enough, but I used 2. Another plus is the bottle is MUCH bigger than I expected, its like twice the size of the gelish ones. Shipping was also very fast, will order again.

  AFTER: I have 22 inch long straight & silky hair. I love to oil my hair before every wash. Generally I use coconut oil or almond oil & leave it at least over night. I wash hair every 3 days. Few days back I see this castor oil here I decided to give it a try. And I am happy that consider it. All I can say is now my hair are more beautiful. All I do is mix 5-6 drops of castor oil with my regular hair oil & then heat it a little & apply thoroughly. It is very thick so a few drops will go a long way so be careful while using it for the first time. If u will use more quantity then it vl be harder to remover oil in one wash. After 2-3 uses one will get idea how much is required for him/her. For the ppl with very dry hair this works best. I am using it only for hair so I have no idea about how it works for other uses. I think mine will last for quite long as I need few drops in every use.Definitely recommend it.

  AFTER: The most I had ever spent on a mascara was about $6 and never ended up being happy with my lashes. I've tried all sorts of brands that promise volume, curl, length ect, but I guess I was never to surprised with my outcome considering the price. Despite that, I could never see spending $20 or more on a tube of mascara that would only last me maybe 6 months, and worst yet, what If I spent the money and still ended up dissapointed. I bought the NYX Doll Eye Mascara on a whim, but it turned out to be the best mascara choice I've ever made.I always start out curling my lashes with a revlon metal lash curler. Usually my lashes don't hold a curl, once I apply mascara there back to their usual straight selves after drying. With the NYX Doll Eye, my lashes held a perfect curl all day. My lashes also looked ALOT longer and I have pretty long eyelashes to begin with so the result was very dramatic.The first time I used this, I only applied one coat and was very happy with the results, minimal clumping but the formula is thick enough to coat each lash nicely, perfect dark black color, shiny and noticable. Since I only wear eye makeup I want my eyes to stand out and mascara is my favorite for this.The second and third time I experimented with more layers. If your going to put on multiple coats I would recommend not waiting in between coats for it to dry. If you do this the result is clumps and messy looking lashes. After curling, I applied a few coats ( the brush holds alot of the mascara on it so unless you wipe of the brush before applying you may not need more on the brush for 3 or 4 coats ) angling the brush to fit in with my lashes which adds volume and oomph because of the way it is shaped. I used to prefer the spoon brush ( for extra curl ), but this style brush gets every lash just right and it is fatter at the ends where your lashes are the shortest and sparse and really plumps them up. The result of 4 coats were beautiful "baby doll" lashes which in my opinion looked even better than falsies ( which to me look funny and fake ).If your struggling to decide whether to try this or not, you really should. For the price of only $9 you will not be dissapointed.

  AFTER: I tried this one while hiding out from the world in Crisfield, Maryland for the Christmas-New Year holiday season with my relatives.  I like it a lot!  I am an "Olay" fan anyway, but have also used some other products.  I heard on the TV that the Olay Regenerist line was "the best" or something like that, so here is my story:It has a nice creamy texture.  It goes on your face smooth and it just really feels good going on.  It does have a semi-heavy scent blast that hits you when you put the first smear on, but it is not overwhelming and it seems to disipate quickly.  My preference would be to have it without the scent.  The cream just feels really good going on your face, kind of like putting your face on a cool satin pillow.  The cream soaks in really nice too.  It does not feel like it's going to rub off on the pillow when you hit the bed 5 minutes later like some other creams do.  It also does not feel sticky like some creams do.  After 4 days use on my face and neck, morning and evening, my face and neck feel really nice and soft (silky soft).  I would think (based on my initial results) that this cream would have really nice results when used over an extended period of time.I believe this cream holds its own against the other face products that I use, which include the Victoria Principal line, the Olay line, and the Seacret line (in the malls, from the Dead Sea). (I switch around between the products.)The directions are really hard to read on this 1.7 oz red jar but they say the usual.  They tell you to apply in small circular motions and avoid getting it into your eyes and to rinse with water if you do. (Duh.  A no-brainer.) It also suggests that you focus on areas like the brow and jaw line.  Olay is a Proctor and Gamble product.I think it is also important to tell you that I am NOT one of those 25 year olds who has young skin anyway and is trying to tell you how beautiful my skin is. LOL.  No offense, but the young whippersnappers haven't had time to mess up their skin yet!  I am 60 years old and am very pleased with my skin.  It is equally important to tell you that I did nothing special to my skin until about 4 years ago when I began a regular face cream routine.  Those 4 years have paid off big time, so if you think it is too late or you are to old to bother, that is probably not true.  I have had plenty of compliments on my skin.With all that said, I recommend a good quality face cream, before bed and upon waking.  This (and the other Olay products) seem to be worth your time and money.  When you do your face, include your neck too.  It shows.  Rub it on in small circles, like they suggest, and rub up (not down). Ohhhh, might I also suggest no frowning.  Only laugh lines are allowed :-)

  AFTER: I love this soap, yea I already love dead sea salt & how softening, moisturizing & just great for skin health it is, so adding it into a bar of soap for me makes it perfect. This soap is smooth & is not at all gritty when using it, not harsh & has a mild scent, the scent does not bother me but might bother others. This soap is great to use for general skin health but is also great for skin issues such as eczema, rough dry skin, psoriasis, hives, rashes acne & more. What I tend to hate about even natural soaps is they leave behind a residue especially if they have any kind of salt in them, this soap not only does not leave behind any residue it rinses off very easily & leaves your skin feeling amazing.You have got to love a soap that is natural, healing, soothing & has soap magnesium, potassium, sodium, zinc & more for a total of 21 minerals needed for skin health & body health. Feel the rich lather that makes you feel like you are not using soap at all, then feel how great it makes your skin feel & look & how others are noticing the great results.Thank you to Adovia for making all these great skin care products, I love what I have tried so far,great company with great communication that really cares about the customers & that is important when buying online.

  AFTER: I've been using IBD Just Gel for almost 2 years with my LED lamp at home. I adore this shade 'My Babe;' which is an opaque creme lilac/lavender. This shade coordinates well with 2014's color of the year 'Radiant Orchid.' It's versatile, being a medium light hue. It's a fun option and a very hip, tasteful Wes Anderson palette lavender - meaning a touch of retro appeal in a subdued hue in comparison to some Easter egg brights I've had before. I'm wearing it a lot this early Spring already. All I had in a lavender hue from IBD before was 'Amethyst Surprise' which is a semi-sheer frost with more neutral blue/grey tones and appeared darker with metallic highlights in appearance. This is my favorite gel lavender.

  AFTER: This is my second favorite mascara after max factor 2000.  As the product says, you get no clumps, and I like the fact that it comes in brown shades.  While this lasts on your eyes longer than max factor, it's not as build-able, so you get less dramatic eyelashes.  If you are just looking for a little emphasis and no-fuss mascara (for work for example), but don't need super big lashes, this would be a good product for you.

I even had a couple of minor breakouts.I stuck with it, like I read on a beauty website, and I'm happy I did.My face is smoother. The sensitivity is gone and I'm not experiencing any more breakouts.I think my skin had to cycle through and turnover old cells (and purge itself of oil and debris)Once that was done, it looks great. Honestly one of the best OTC creams I've used. I also use Retin-a (for wrinkle prevention) and find this to be a great night cream on the days I don't use the Retin-a.

  AFTER: This is a very good hair dryer. It's Ionic/Tourmaline/Ceramic which is supposed to be easy on hair and minimize frizz. My hair is coarse and kinky and after drying it's smooth, frizz & static free. I use it to dry my hair and then use a flat iron, so I haven't used the diffuser and concentrator attachments. The dryer has Hot/warm, low/high settings and a cool shot. In my opinion, it's relatively quiet. It also has a vent on the back that you have to clean out, which is a new feature than what I'm used to. It's a good thing because a strand of my hair got sucked into the back of the last one (what do you even do about that?) The directions are stated very clear and tell you how to take care of your hair dryer. Revlon is a great trusted brand, and for $16 this is fantastic. Highly recommend.

  AFTER: I read some great reviews for the Aveeno body wash and body lotion so I decided to try both of them. I use the Aveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Body Wash with Natural Oatmeal when I take my shower. It is like a cleanser that leaves my skin soft without the feeling of a film or an oil. After the shower, I follow up with this lotion.This lotion makes me feel moisturized. It blends into the skin quickly and easily and you can tell when the product has blended into your skin--you don't have to go on rubbing for ages. It doesn't really have much of a smell although sometimes I will get a whiff and it has kind of an odd scent but by the time you rub it in there really isn't a smell that I am aware of. This is great because if you wear perfume you don't have to worry about fragrances clashing. If you are like me and avoid perfumes, this is great because perfumey lotions make my nose itch and then I start sneezing.This lotion is not like any other lotion I have tried. It does not make me feel greasy like some lotions. The consistency does not feel watery so that while I am putting it on it feels like slightly thickened water and when I am done putting it on I know have to put on two more layers of lotion to get a decent layer of moisture on my skin. Unlike other lotions, my skin does not dry out and look dried out a few hours after putting it on. Unlike other lotions, this one is not overbearingly thick, requiring extra muscles to spread the lotion and rub it in.Basically, when you are done it feels like your skin, like you aren't wearing anything, like the way your skin is meant to feel rather than feeling like your skin is covered with layers of a moisturizing product.

I decided to use this in the shower along with my shampoo....i would add shampoo and a quarter size of this castor oil in my hands, mix it up and work it through my hair.... then i will add it with my conditioner but only concentrate on my ends. I'm not sure if my hair is growing with this product, but it makes it very very shiny! (esp for someone who has damaged hair) i get tons of compliments asking if i went to a salon to put a gloss on it.... its very nice.

While some folks hate the large brush and tube of these newer ones, I don't mind them, and I love the new bristle brushes that coat without leaving clumps.  I've already had good luck using the regular Lash Blast (the one in the orange tube), but I thought I'd try this new one to see how it works.  I really like it, and it really does leave zero clumps!The curved brush on this also does a nice job of adding a gentle curl to your lashes. The non-waterproof formula stays put, even when my allergies are acting up and my eyes are teary.I bought this in the Very Black color, and it's still natural-looking.Like all Cover Girl mascaras, this also comes off easily, with just some eye makeup remover or face wash and water.  You don't have to tug or pull at your eyes.It's a keeper!

I don't like to use my expensive skin products on these areas because the costs add up quickly.The problem with Lubriderm is that it contains fragrance.  I was hoping this Aveeno would be even more gentle and mild, since it doesn't contain perfume.  Not so.  For 3 days in a row, I wore this on my chest and hands and suffered horrible watery eyes and runny nose.  I'm not sure quite what to do.  I might just have to use face products on my chest and hands.  How frustrating.

I am  impressed!!! so if your looking for something that will help firm and minimize wrinkles and not harsh on the skin and easy to find ...this is it!!I gave it a 4 rating because I do not care for the heavy container and the lid...but product inside is really good!

  AFTER: This is a very good hair dryer. It's Ionic/Tourmaline/Ceramic which is supposed to be easy on hair and minimize frizz. My hair is coarse and kinky and after drying it's smooth, frizz & static free. I use it to dry my hair and then use a flat iron, so I haven't used the diffuser and concentrator attachments. The dryer has Hot/warm, low/high settings and a cool shot. In my opinion, it's relatively quiet. It also has a vent on the back that you have to clean out, which is a new feature than what I'm used to. It's a good thing because a strand of my hair got sucked into the back of the last one (what do you even do about that?) The directions are stated very clear and tell you how to take care of your hair dryer. Revlon is a great trusted brand, and for $16 this is fantastic. Highly recommend.

  AFTER: That's the only way to describe it is OMG. Some of my hair came out because of heat damage, I stupidly was hot combing my hair sometimes twice a day and some of my hair said NOPE and bye bye. I was devastated, one side was the shortest it's ever been, a bit past my ear lobe. I did not give this a 5 because I'm still waiting for the extra umph that goes with JBCO but it's been less than a month and my hair has grown back. I am AA with SLOW growing 4b hair so slow I can scream, I've mixed this product with pepppermint oil but I fully believe that my hair would not have grown back as quickly as it has with this product. Did I mention how SLOW my hair growth rate really is? It is thick so I diluted it with a melted hair growth grease, rub it in every night, and braid my hair into 2 braids and take it out in the morning. This is "THE" miracle product! I fully believe my hair would still be short if I wasn't using this product. This is a must get for all women!

  AFTER: If you check my review of Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum, you will see that I truly believe that the combination of the two have helped to keep my sixty-four-year-old skin looking softer, less wrinkled and better than the skin of most women my age.I'm not conceited; I inherited my good skin from my mother.  I also have always hated to sit in the sun.  I do have sun damage but it's mostly on the rest of my body because it came from my swimming; not my lying in the sun without sun protection.  My lovely face was protected because I used to swim underwater so much!In a nutshell, I was a dubious purchaser of this Olay Regenerist line when it first came out and I wouldn't be without it, all these years later.  Oh, and as an aside, I wish my mother, who was a strong proponent of using moisturizer, had told me to put it on the Back of my neck, not just the front.  If she had, I wouldn't have to back out of rooms, as I do today.A note:  I'm still looking for the absolutely perfect moisturizer, forgetting that I'm wearing it.  During a recent special, I ordered a moisturizer that cost $89 a bottle.  I had some samples and after using them for nine days, I decided not to open it when if arrived because I think my Regenerist works far better. Have I learned my lesson?  You bet I have!

  AFTER: Olay Regenerist Microsculpting Cream does what it is advertised to do.  This is the third or fourth jar that I have had, but this is the first time I've ordered it from Amazon, and Amazon's price is good.I've tried much more expensive facial creams and lotions and they either didn't work as well, or for the money they were no better.  The Microsculpting Cream is a rich cream that doesn't go on heavy, but has just enough moisturization for my combination skin without being too much or leaving my skin too dry.  The best feature of the cream, for me at least, is its sculpting ability, especially around the jawline.  After a couple of weeks of use, I can always see my jawline tighten up enough that it's noticeable.  At 66, that's definitely worth it!I chose to get the scented cream just because I enjoy a little scent to cosmetic products, but it is available in unscented.  It doesn't take a whole lot for one use, so this lasts a good while. Since I have a mild case of rosacea, I put a thin layer of Finacea lotion (from my dermatologist) on first, then the Regenerist Cream.  It's good for the neck, too.Highly recommended.

It cleans without stripping natural oils, and it keeps me from being all stinky- hey in Arizona you have to watch that in summer;)I love the light scent of this product, and all of Adovia's products really.. it is fresh and clean smelling without being overwhelming or too girly. Just the right scent.I am still using their shampoo and conditioner, so it is a great complement for all 3 together.Thanks again to Adovia for a great product!

  AFTER: I really like this mascara by Covergirl. It is a good, low-price mascara for daytime wear. However, this mascara is NOT going to be a plumper...it is a good basic mascara for length. I haven't had any issues with clumping or with smudging with this mascara.

  AFTER: I'm 51 and tried this because Oprah recommended it in her top 10 anti-aging moisturizers.  Smells great.  Feels semi-light. Used it for 3 days and broke out like a teenager.  My face was so shiny at work the first day, I almost didn't recognize myself.  I don't have oily skin.  Might work for people that don't have sensitive skin.  Apparently that's not me.  Very happy to pay half the price with Amazon than the store!  I just can't use it.  Went back to Garnier Skin Care Renew with spf 28.  Cheaper product. Has spf.  Never breaks me out.

  AFTER: The product does exactly what it says... you'll get volume without your eyelashes clumping together, and the enjoy the added benefit that your mascara won't flake off or smudge during the day. It isn't waterproof for those who prefer waterproof mascara; it does come off very easily when washing your face. I actually like this better than a few of the higher priced brands, but must state that I don't wear contacts, so am not sure how it would work for those who do. It hasn't seemed to dry out my lashes (causing breakage) as some mascaras have. It's a basic, budget-friendly mascara that doesn't go on in globs and seems to hold up well throughout the day.

  AFTER: I needed a hair dryer to use about once or twice a month. I found this at a great price with mostly good reviews so I decided to purchase it. I am transitioning to natural kinky/curly hair and have BSL hair overall. I almost always air dry so i needed something to dry it if I was ever in a hurry. What I was looking for was: at least 1875 Watt dryer, Ionic, Compact, With multiple attachments (at least comb, diffuser and concentrator), Not too loud. This dryer fills all those requirements... except for one thing: no comb-attachment.Since this came with two attachments, I planned to purchase the third one from Revlon. For those unaware, Revlon hair products are licensed to Helen of Troy. I contacted HoT to inquire about which model of comb would fit this dryer, since most comb attachments are expensive and I did not want to waste my money. They were very fast to respond but no one could tell me if there was one available that would fit. After a week, I received an email saying that they do not make a comb attachment that would fit this particular model. They said that this particular dryer has a specific nozzle so no other attachments from them, or other brands would fit it. I was disappointed, since nowhere in the package or description page does it say this. Perhaps I was naive to think that a company would never think not to make other attachments that would fit their best selling economy model, other than the standard out of the box ones. Now I have to think if this dryer was worth it at all. Who wants to buy a separate dryer just for that one extra task?About the product:Pros:lightweight, unbulky overall.Heats up considerably. Warm is an adequate setting for me, but it might be too hot for someone with very fine straight hair.2 attachments, including the concentrator.good value for the price.fast shipping.Medium noiseCons:Cord is too short. Does not rotate easily either.Very cheap plastic, i'm afraid this could melt with heavy prolonged use.Can only be used with the specific attachments that come with it (2), which are not for sale separately (If you contact Helen of Troy they might send you some for free if yours break)Diffuser is a joke. Not long enough for long hair to dry effectively. The fingers are too short and it's not concave so the hot air just stays in the surface. People's heads are nor flat, Revlon!Conclusion:If you use your hair dryer very often, for long periods of time uninterrupted, this might die on you. If you use it very irregularly it's a good balance between the price and use. If you want to use other attachments other than the ones that come with it, you might be out of luck. If you are purchasing this solely for the diffuser, I would stay away from this. Would I purchase this again if it broke down? No, I wouldn't, but it will do for the time being.

Also even without getting anything in your eye they sting a little just from the fumes, particularly when it is still drying, but slightly all day as well.As I said it works well as a body moisturizer but leaves my skin feeling a bit sticky.

When I mixed this with the rest of the oils, I noticed it was definitely thicker and stickier. I left it on overnight under a cap and rinsed it out the next morning. Not only was my hair softer, but the texture changed! Instead of frizzy curls, my curly hair was silky smooth. After these results, I wish I could use this everynight.. I'd never have a bad hair day again. I love this oil and the positive effects it has on my hair.

This soap will lather up really well and rinses off clean and leaving your skin smelling fresh and smooth like a baby.This soap will leave your skin feeling soft and hydrated. And I should know because I have really dry skin and am always looking for the best product to get my skin back in shape without having to spend a fortune. I have seen several comments that say it works really good on eczema, so if you have that skin condition, give it a try and see if it helps you.

Majority of it is used on my ankle and I can honestly say that the first day I used it the pain went away!  Just to make sure I was'nt tripping out I had my mother to try it on her ankle and did not say anything eto her about it.  She was in a car accident years ago and her ankle got broke and she has had pain in it every since and nothing seems to help she even have had cortisone shots for it.  After she put it on her ankle she came eto be about 20 min. after and ask what was it because her pain was gone and she wanted more of it!  I gave her half of the bottle and niether one of us have been in pain.  I dont know how well it works for the hair,skin, lashes and eyebrows, but it is GREAT FOR PAIN!

It's going to make a great polish for the summer - it looks a bit outlandish and whackadoodle in the cold winter months, but it's a great dupe to Tiki Tiki Laranga by Gelish, for half the price!I also bought Turtle Bay, and have loved it as well. It's a gorgeous teal, that leans more toward a blue than a green tone. It's going to be great for summer.I've been satisfied with the IBD polishes I've received so far, and absolutely love the prices. They last as long as gelish (which is usually until I get bored and soak them off!), and have such pretty, vibrant colors! At this time, I've been using them with the Gelish Foundation and Top It Off, and curing under an LED.

  AFTER: Recently, I was told by a dermatologist I needed to use a moisturizer and was given some recommendations, of which Aveeno was one. I narrowed it down to EucerinEucerin Skin Calming Daily Moisturizing Creme, 14 Ounce Tubes (Pack of 2)and CetaphilCetaphil Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion, 8.0-Ounce Tubes(Pack of 2)for daily use. This Aveeno didn't make my final cut because it seemed just a bit "heavier" on the face than the other two. But since I had it, I stuck it in my gym bag and began using it after workouts. Now, I love it for that purpose. Maybe after a workout my body appreciates something a tad heavier.I never thought i would be writing about moisturizers but since I created a little research project for myself, I thought I should share my findings.

  AFTER: First let me start off by letting you know about some of the key factors of this soap.- Infused with 100% Pure Dead Sea Salts from the Dead Sea- Dead Sea Salt Contains over 21 Minerals Key to Skin Health and Beauty- Deeply Moisturizing and Hydrating Soap great for Dry and Normal to Dry Skin- Dead Sea Minerals Essential to Skin Function Contained in the Soap Include Magnesium, Potassium, Sodium, Zinc and More.- Great Value and Benefits for A Daily Moisturizing Facial CleanserI have recently shared reviews of other products from this particular brand. I really like the fact that when I am using these products I can see a difference in my skin. With this soap my skin really felt clean, smooth and nourished after washing.I feel like Adovia prides themselves on making quality products for women who are looking for quality and results in the beauty products that they purchase. I am also very interested in the fact that they use minerals and salt from the Dead Sea.Adovia Moisturizing Mineral Soap comes in a sleekly designed box weighing 4.4 oz. It is a very decent sized bar of soap that will last most women a long time. Because the product actually works and makes my skin feel amazing I feel it is definitely worth the price ($11) because it lasts so long you only have to splurge on it every now and then.I would recommend this line of products to any woman that wants to keep their dry, or normal to dry skin clean, nourished and refreshed.

Maybe you're only supposed to use it on the scalp, because I used it on the length of my hair. I will keep buying it, because it is a good moisturizer for dry lips and skin, but does not do anything for my hair and makes my scalp itchy.

  AFTER: I started using this on my face, and on one hand. I wanted to see if there was a difference between my two hands after using it for a few weeks. I can definitely say I see a difference in my skin on the treated hand. It's not anything a stranger would comment on randomly or anything... but it's noticeable to me. The skin is a bit thicker and smoother, and the veins don't stand out as much. It's not a miracle worker, but it is definitely making a difference. My skin on my face seems healthier and brighter when I've been using it. It's a definite keeper!

  AFTER: There are several key things that I look for when it comes to trying a new soap or body wash: scent, lather, how easily it washes off the skin, how my skin feels afterwards (including if my skin feels moisturized or dried out), if I can use it on my face/shave with it and how long the soap lasts. I wasted no time in putting this soap to the test.Scent- This soap smells AMAZING. The best way I can describe the scent is to say that it smells really &#34;clean&#34;. There is something else to the scent (faint floral notes?) but I can not place it. I thought the smell was a little overpowering when I first removed it from the box, but it isn't overpowering as you use it in the shower. It actually makes your entire bathroom smell amazing for hours after your shower. The scent also lingers a little on your skin (not a lot, but enough to be pleasant and make you feel clean).Lather- This soap not only lathers well, but it does so easily. You use very little of the soap when in the shower.How easily does it wash off the skin- Very easily. It does not stick to your skin or make you feel like you have to work to rinse it off.How does my skin feel after using- I feel really clean and smell amazing. The soap does not dry out my skin at all like most soaps do. My skin doesn't necessarily feel moist, but it doesn't feel dry or sore either. It feels soft, clean and healthy.Can I use it on my face/shave with it- Yes! If I use other bar soaps on my face it is peeling and dry when I get out of the shower. I have been using this Adovia Mineral Soap on my face for 2 weeks with no peeling or dryness. It makes my face feel so much cleaner than the facial wash I was using previously. I love it on my face! I have also not had as many breakouts. I have also been using this to shave. Since it lathers so well and is not drying, it makes shaving really easy.How long does the soap last- Well, I have been using this soap for about 2 weeks now. As of now the bar looks almost the original size. You can even still faintly see the Adovia stamp on the bar. It appears that this Adovia Mineral Soap will last for a long time.As you can see, the Adovia Dead Sea Salt Moisturizing Mineral Soap passed all of my tests with flying colors. The soap is currently on sale on Amazon for $11 with free shipping for everyone. I normally would not spend that much on a bar of soap, but this soap is definitely worth trying. I recommend it!

I just mixed it with my almond oil and diluted it with some water and generously applied it to my roots and ends and the next day my hair was nice and soft. I haven't seen any growth yet but I'm sure I will.I recommend this to those who are transitioning to natural hair.

  AFTER: This is my favorite mascara of all time and, coming from a middle schooler obsessed with makeup, I've tried a looot of mascaras. If you are looking for length, this will give you length. Even if your lashes are short and stubby, this mascara will make your lashes look long and luscious. It doesn't do much for volume though so if you are looking to thicken your lashes this isn't that mascara for you. Although I would recommend the NYX doll eye volume waterproof mascara.

  AFTER: This soap helps to defeat dry skin!  I love this soap and cannot say enough good things about it.  It smells great and rinses clean with no film or residue. It also gently exfoliates your skin.  I started using it on my face but when I saw how much better my skin looked started using it on my whole body.  Let me give you some back story about my skin, it is a dry, flaky, rashy, hot mess.  So when I first tried this soap I wasn't expecting much. After using in once, I noticed the skin on my face wasn't tight feeling like it is when I use my normal soap.  My face was soft and smooth.  So I tried it on the rest of my body, and what a difference it has made! I now longer have to apply lotion continuously all day long. Once and I'm good to go!  Also, I'm not trying to make any health claims or anything.  It could just be coincidence but after using this soap for a week, the eczema on my arms ( that has been there for years) has cleared considerably, and my skin is no longer painfully dry.  If you have skin issues, give this soap a try and see how it works for you. For me it has really made a difference! Thanks Adovia!

They keep asking me what I use. I rarely get three hours of sleep and I'm very stressed out because of the loss of two family members in one year but you wouldn't know this by looking at my skin; it seems to be glowing all the time. I also apply Loreal skin genesis religiously every night, but I attribute my great skin to olay regenerist. I'm 38 by the way so great skin is does not come easy at this stage.

  AFTER: Overall, I felt this nail polish was good quality for the price. However, it was not exactly what I expected for a few reasons:(1) COLOR - From looking at the photo of the bottle, I thought this polish would be pink.  However, the color is actually silver with just a slight pink/purple tint.(2) TRANSPARENCY - The polish much more transparent than I thought it would be.  Therefore, I had to put on 3-4 layers to get a nice thick layer of glitter.  However, if you are looking for something that does not overload the sparkles, this polish may be for you.

  AFTER: i haven't used any needle roller before and I did try it once, I don't think I even punctured my skin, I was barely touching it on my face and it was a little too much for me, but I am a sissy with pain. So I ordered the 0.5mm size and that one I can tolerate and do properly. Just remember to clean face and hands good, always use clean/disinfected roller. I just used the bleach and water solution and soak it for 10 mins, but just bought some alcohol and will be using the alcohol to disinfect it a little.When rolling, roll in one direction, someone recommended to just roll once direction, then lift and roll again. I did try that roll once, but now I get the hang of it, I can roll on the same area without moving the roller to much, repeat 8-10 tiems. When you move the roller while rolling it can potentially cut your face so please be careful. You will notice your face turning red and some areas where its not too red, then I just go over that area with a roller again. I had been doing this for 2 weeks now so haven't really noticed a significant change. But I can tell that when I applied the Hyaluronic with C & E, it really gets soaked up right away and my skin is softer. Also I was doing the peel and had noticed some chages on my pores, getting smaller, yeeey! So I really dont know whats working, but Im sure its the combination of Peel, Roller and Hyaluronic acid.

I have very dry skin and it's for the first time in a long, long while that I feel my skin softer and more hydrated. I use the body wash in conjunction with Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion and the results are very good. I have no idea what "colloidal oatmeal" is, but is seems to work, and that's good enough for me! Oh, and I only need to use a small quantity, so it's definitely worth the money.

  AFTER: I purchased this item to replace an ancient, 1980's-era blow dryer, and based my choice on its excellent reviews. I have to agree, this is an excellent product. I first noticed that even on the highest setting the dryer did not get as hot as my old one. I thought this might be a problem, but actually it is an advantage as it won't burn you if you leave it in one place too long. The volume of air being pushed out of this dryer is far stronger than my old hair dryer, so it dries very fast. I have naturally wavy hair that tends to frizz and I used the dryer to straighten it. Much to my surprise, this dryer not only dried my hair very quickly, it left it very smooth with no frizz. It must be the lower heat with the strong blast of air that works so well. Whatever it is, I highly recommend it!

  AFTER: My only complaint is that I use the concentrator attachment regularly and the attachment snaps on really loosely, so the concentrator (the attachment that you use to narrow the heat concentration) rotates and changes angle multiple times when I'm trying to blow my hair dry. It's pretty annoying, but I'm learning to deal with it. Overall, it was really cost effective and it's small so it will be good for traveling, and it's pretty powerful too.

  AFTER: Before purchasing JBCO I researched it for about a year.  WHY OH WHY did it take me so long to purchase?!!!!  This is a must have staple within your head to toe daily beauty regime!  It has a faint peanutty type of smell, but it's nothing that I can't deal with.  When I'm using this on my scalp and hair, whether it's before bed or styling for the day, once I use it, I spray my hair with Palmer's Olive Oil with Vitamin E hair spray because it has a nice clean smell that gives my hair that high gloss sheen all day long.  You will see results with this product so be patient.  Everyone's hair grows at a different pace.  It also depends on how much and how often you apply this product.  I also use it on my eyelashes and around my eyes for my night moisturizer, as well as for blemishes, dry cracked skin, cuts, burns, it is an all purpose beauty secret.  A little goes a long way.

  AFTER: First of all I must say that this oil is about the best thing you can put on your skin. I had known about castor oil's reputation as a laxative and hair growth aid, but I'm very skeptic with "miracle" products, even when they're natural. But I have to say that this oil really impressed me. I have been using different natural oils like coconut and olive oil infused with rosemary leaves on my hair with very good results, but 2 days ago I applied this oil to my scalp and hair and went to bed with a shower cap on. I washed my hair the next morning and I was amazed at the luxurious softness of my hair, with a healthy shine and with volume, not a single sign of greasiness whatsoever. Just soft, beautiful hair. It actually feels like baby hair. Another thing is that I noticed much less hair breakage and shedding when I combed my hair in the shower. Just a few strands, because my hair was so smooth it did not tangle much. My hair is relaxed, colored, thin and dry and breaks easy, but I'm sure this oil is going to help me keep it moisturized and with less breakage.It also works very well on the skin, although I've never used it on my face, except my eyelids, eyelashes and eyebrows. I apply it all over my body every night after a shower and I wake up with baby soft skin that is not greasy. The oil is thick and kind of sticky for a minute, but your skin will absorb it completely after a while and it won't feel greasy. It makes my skin feel more elastic and young, and I only get that feeling with expensive firming creams I cannot afford to use all over. It is not completely odorless, but the smell is very faint and kind of goes away after a few minutes and it's easily covered up with lotion or cologne. It's great for dry lips and tired looking eyes. I apply a tiny drop on my eyelids and the area where dark circles form and massage. The next morning my eyes look fresh and eyelids and nice and plump. My son has chronic eczema and this oil keeps his skin nicely moisturized and doesn't irritate his skin like most creams do. I also put some on my hands before doing the dishes and protects my hands. This oil is a godsend and I see myself using it for years to come. I wish I could give it 10 stars.

  AFTER: Yet another superb product from Adovia!  I have now tried 2 products from Adovia containing the dead sea salt minerals and I have not been disappointed in either one.  I have been using this bar of soap for 4 days now and my skin is so soft and I feel so much more clean when I get out of the shower now.  I live in a very old house that has TERRIBLE water with rust and even the water softener does not help.  Since I started using the Adovia products I received my hair and skin has been so much better!  Using this soap has actually even helped reduce my acne.This soap smells so clean and fresh; comes in a regular size bar and is a very silky smooth white color.  The moment I opened the box from Amazon I could smell it and it was like heaven :)  I love body products that are not heavily perfumed but just smell wonderfully fresh.  You can most definitely smell the ocean in Adovia products, and of course with all of the minerals from the Dead Sea Salts it is always good for your skin.This specific product retails for $11 on Amazon and although it may seem expensive for a bar of soap, the benefits FAR outweigh the costs if you appreciate the healthiness that comes along with using the product :)  Just check out the gorgeous photos of the sea salts that make the products!  Imagine being able to swim in that water every day and the health benefits it would bring!  Then just think of this soap and if you try it you will be hooked!***I received a complimentary product in exchange for an honest and open review***

  AFTER: ok, there is limited clumpiness, but I still found myself pulling out my handy dandy lash separating tool, which is fine, i don't mind the extra effort but I did not find any Wow factor with this mascara. Personally I think the LashBlast Volume (orange tube) is much more clump crushing, I NEVER have clumps or any lashes sticking together even after applying layer on top of layer, and it fans it out perfectly enough where I don't even need my separating tool. This one is ok, but when this runs out im sticking with last blast volume.

I have also mixed with other oils like coconut and/or jojoba when using as co-wash, deep conditioning, or with leave-in conditioners.

  AFTER: I've been using it for 3 days and I already see a difference around my laugh line, basically it's gone. To be fair, I had the beginning stages of laugh lines and this combined with my normal skin care work wonderfully. It is important to note that I should have purchased the 0.5mm because the 1.0mm stings. I'm still getting used to the shock of the stinging sensation. Its stops immediately  after you're done passing the area in your face. Also, make sure that your skin care doesn't add on to the inflammation of your face. I used Apple Cider Vinegar as my skin toner and I make sure not to use it the same day as I use my micro needle roller. Please be aware that sunscreen is very important. I am a person of color and I use the sensitive Oil Of Olay sunscreen moisturizer. I have not broken out at all using it for the year and a half that I've used it.Again, this product is a great complimentary with your skin care line just make sure that you don't use products that is alcohol based or inflammatory skin care product the same day. You'll need a soothing product. If you use natural products I'd suggest a little grapeseed oil afterward on your skin.Oh most importantly, wash your face first and I forgot to mention DO NOT ADD PRESSURE as you roll the micro needle roller on your face. Just roll it on your face, for me I roll it twice around in one direction. You may try it differently but do not add pressure the needles are already doing their job.Hope this helps someone with sensitive skin.

  AFTER: I bought this as one component of a shave oil I made for my boyfriend, but now I use it on my skin when it needs a little extra moisture. It seems to absorb well and be pretty much odorless. The price here is much better than the brick and mortar stores in my area, too.

Very profuse sweating but not too much.  buy it you will love it forever ...as i have.  i get the 32 ounce bottle.  it softens skin on hands and feet also ...  No success using it on my hair or face.  It was a bit irritating. blessings

  AFTER: I bought Cover Girl Clump Crusher mascara last week, after seeing a recommendation in "Vogue" magazine.  The model used in their photoshoot had gorgeous eyelashes, and I'm pleased to see that this mascara really delivers!! You'll get your own runway-worthy eyes with the long, thickly emphasized lashes this product delivers.I've tried a number of other mascara products, and this one is my favorite by far.  I've also got sensitive eyes and skin, and need cosmetics that don't cause an allergic reaction.  This is a gentle formula and I've experienced no flaking, so contact lens wearers don't need to worry.It doesn't smear much even if you have to rub your eyes, and washes off easily at the end of the day.I also enjoy Million Lashes by L'Oreal, but Clump Crusher beats it. The price was a little lower than L'oreal here as well. Try it and love it!

  AFTER: Decided to try it out due to the rave reviews on Reddit's /MakeupAddiction. It does not deserve the hype. I didn't like it at all.It gave me very stiff, clumpy lashes. After a short period of wear it began to flake off and my lash-line became irritated and itchy. This is when I decided it had to go, and I took it off.I've never had an allergic reaction to a mascara so I'm guessing it was due to this product and not an overall sensitivity. I have full lashes, maybe it would be better for somebody with thin lashes, I kinda doubt it though.For a product named clump crusher, and then produced clumps, I mean come on. 1 star. I can't think of a mascara I've liked less.

  AFTER: I received a free product to review for my blog, and I am never disappointed by Adovia.I have been using this soap all over for a few weeks now, and I have nothing but good to say about it. It cleans without stripping natural oils, and it keeps me from being all stinky- hey in Arizona you have to watch that in summer;)I love the light scent of this product, and all of Adovia's products really.. it is fresh and clean smelling without being overwhelming or too girly. Just the right scent.I am still using their shampoo and conditioner, so it is a great complement for all 3 together.Thanks again to Adovia for a great product!

  AFTER: I am a 23 years old black female with horrendous 10 years old light brown stretch marks running all over my forearms. I have been dealing with them since the age of 13 and haven't worn a tank top in the past 10 years of my life. I have tried countless creams, oils (and the list goes on) to get rid of them as laser treatment was out of the question (Laser treatment for stretchies is not designed to work on black people's skin), I have waisted hundreds and hundreds of dollars with no significant improvement, the horrendous stretchies were still visible and ruining my life. Around the age of 19 I decided to stop wasting my money and my hopes and decided to get used to the fact that I may never be able to rock a tank top or the strapless wedding dress of my dreams "Sigh".Then in summer 2012 I moved to Africa to stay with my mum for a while, the sun is really hot here and long sleeves tops are out of the question but since I don't have much of a choice...I decided to stick to my long sleeved tops but then I realized that I couldn't possibly spend the rest of my life hiding my arms in long sleeved tops...I just couldn't give up so I embarked on a new stretch marks removal journey.I started using my own blend of shea butter and natural oils because I heard that it was amazingly good when it came to fading stretch marks up to 50 %. So I faithfully applied my mix twice a day for 4 months non-stop, the process was extremely slow but little new skin patches started building over my old stretch marks, they were very tiny skin filaments like, very thin and see through, It was not very noticeable unless I looked at them closely...4 months for that little progress I was really annoyed but I kept going until I remembered reading about skin needling.I heard about it back in 2012 but at that time the idea of using a roller covered with needles onto my skin felt like torture to me and it didn't help that I was sceptical from years of living with false hopes and believing the hype about stretch mark treatments, so I never gave it a second thought (BIG MISTAKE, I feel like slapping myself on this one)So I decided to do my homework and researched skin needling, cons and pros, how it works...Basically its sort of a collagen, elastin rebuilder and that's what's lacking in stretch marks, the collagen stopped being produced while the skin was stretching, hence the appearance of stretch marks.I ordered the 1.0 mm without the numbing cream ( I just wanted to get used to the pain of rolling without numbing the skin first in case I went to a place where I couldn't get any). The first time I used it, I could barely tolerate the pain, so I only rolled it over the skin a few time without applying too much pressure. My skin turned red after a few minutes, and it was stinging a bit but nothing to cry over (The redness went down after 30 minutes and the pain an hour later). I then applied my shea butter mix, because apparently it penetrates up to 80% better into the skin because of the micro channels created by the needles.(I then proceeded to socking the roller into alcohol in order to clean it).Apparently it takes 30 to 40 days for the skin to be fully regenerated/healed, so I only roll once every 30 days to give my skin a chance to regenerate (but I still apply my shea butter mix everyday, twice a day).After the first 30 days had passed I noticed thicker skin patches (the filaments were getting thicker), new filaments appeared over my dented stretch marks too, I was seeing progress but nothing to be euphoric about...I thought maybe because I hadn't rolled properly the first time, there wasn't enough collagen produced to build more skin, so I decided that on my next roll I would do better.On my second roll (Second Month), I did it properly, I rolled all over my skin in various directions  (which I hadn't done the first time), I applied pressure evenly (even drew out a few drops of blood). The redness was way stronger than the first time and the pain was unbearable after the rolling, it was stinging badly, my forearms were painful, it all went down after 4 hours, I knew I had done a good job this time around. I also did not forget to clean my roller and apply my shea butter mix to my skin.25 days later my skin had very thick skin patches building all over my stretchies, even on the dented one, I can't believe this, they are turning into fragmented stretch marks because various thick patches of skin are appearing over them, The skin is even looking, healthy, thick and strong...30 days later the skin was still building, the patches were still getting thicker and more obvious, it's a miracle...I don't even know how to explain how happy and thrilled I am about this treatment. I have hope that my stretch marks will fully be covered with new skin in maybe a year or less. I will keep you guys updated every 30 days on my progress. Maybe some day I will wear the wedding dress of my dreams lolI'm sold, I'm a believer...Dermarollers are a wonderful creation, if you have old stretch marks or even new, give it a try. But remember consistency and patience are key (also the cream you use will determine how efficient the dermaroller will be on your skin).----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE: 08-Aug-2013 - End of the 3rd Month - Beginning of the 4th MonthIt's been a month since I last rolled my skin, tomorrow I will be derma rolling once again.I'm very excited and happy to say that this is the month I have seen the most improvement on my stretch marks, for those of you who don't know, tomorrow will be be the fourth month on my derma rolling journey.The following day after derma rolling at the beginning of the month, my skin had already started the healing process, there was already some new filaments appearing over a few spots, and islets of skin appearing within my dented stretch marks. As the weeks went by, the islets appearing within my dented stretch marks started growing outward towards my surrounding healthy skin and eventually started connecting to them to form fuller skin patches.The skin filaments that were thin last month have increased in size and the thicker ones have completely blended in with my surrounding healthy skin.My stretch marks are still visible but not as much as earlier this month, the thicker and fuller the skin filaments and islets get the more my stretch marks seem to fade or blend better with the healthier skin.I would say I have re-built 25 to 30% of healthy skin tissues over my stretch marks so far, it may seem little to some but to me it's the improvement I have been waiting for, for the past 10 years of my life.This month I have seen the most improvement on my dented stretch marks, which is surprising because I was expecting the shallow ones to heal faster but they seem to heal at the same speed or maybe  little bit faster (Which I'm not complaining about, on the contrary). I also believe that the use of my shea butter mix has played an important role in the skin healing process (it contains vitamin e and other good vitamins that are important for skin regeneration). Like I said and I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH, the lotion you use along with the derma roller will determine how well your skin will heal and how efficient the derma roller will be.One last thing that may be of interest to some of you, I now have hair follicles appearing where the new skin has re-built itself which is a sign that my damaged follicles are being revived, there is new hair growing out of them too, a sign that the derma roller seems to really heal the skin from within.I'm very excited and I can't wait to see the results of this month skin needling.I will keep you guys updated. My next update should be next month October 6th, 2013.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE: 06-Oct-2013 - End of the 4th Month - Beginning of the 5th MonthI know I'm a few days behind but I have been so busy with work and everything else that I didn't get a chance to sit down properly and write a review (I don't like rushing my reviews lol).Let's get to what we are here for. I derma rolled my skin on the 6th of October, rolled in various directions as usual (I stopped rolling really hard because just a slight pressure seems to do the trick). My stretch marks have improved by another 10%...so there is an improvement of I would say 40% overall. The way I would describe the way my stretch marks look now...it's like they are melting into my skin, they appear to be fading in, blending in...They have also really shrank in width which is unbelievable. I now feel less self-conscious about them because they are lot more discreet than they were when I fisrt started dermarolling. I think I'll need between 3 to 5 more sections before they are really gone. Not much to say, they are just filling in...I was so worried that the dermaroller might stop working after some time (like many people said) but it still works perfectly fine...my skin is still getting renewed. (See you on the 3rd of November for another update)------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE: 03-Nov-2013 - End of the 5th Month - Beginning of the 6th MonthI can't believe I forgot to dermaroll, thank God I remembered 2 days later...I have been too busy with work...There isn't much to report except that my stretch marks continue to fade...From now on I will be updating every 3 months until they have faded by at least 90 % otherwise I will feel like I'm repeating myself every time I update lol. At least 3 months is enough to see a huge difference...as of now my stretch marks have faded by at least 50%...My mother keeps saying your stretch marks are fading...she is so shocked, she can't believe it...I still feel like I'm in a dream, I would have never thought they would fade this much, I'm so glad I haven't given up.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE: 26-Jan-2014 - End of the 8th Month - Beginning of the 9th Month

  AFTER: I've been using this for the past 2 days and am very happy with the results.The color is evenly distributed by the brush so that when I use my lash curler they look very full with none of those annoying globs of mascara you have to pull off or smooth away. My only complaint is that I wish the applicator was a little thinner for better control.  I have small fingers (like a lot of women) and it's kind of a pain using the brush on the bottom row of lashes.The color is a true black and I haven't had to do any touch-ups since I applied it 10 hours ago, and my lashes still look great.UPDATE:  1/30/13I just had to update my original review to 5 stars after using it for over 3 weeks.The brush separates my lashes each and every day without any clogging, clumping or flaking. I've used other brands that have cost less and some that have cost 4 times as much and have never had such consistant and exceptional results. I keep waiting for it to fail but it never disappoints.As someone who has always used an eyelash curler, I'm used to having to feather my lashes each time I curl them - but not with this mascara. Not once. I put it on, use my curler and I'm done.  And they look fabulous!And as for my original complaint about the applicator being to thick - forgive me for being an idiot.  Who cares about a little inconvenience for brief minutes when the results are outstanding and last for hours. Not me anymore.

  AFTER: If you check my review of Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum, you will see that I truly believe that the combination of the two have helped to keep my sixty-four-year-old skin looking softer, less wrinkled and better than the skin of most women my age.I'm not conceited; I inherited my good skin from my mother.  I also have always hated to sit in the sun.  I do have sun damage but it's mostly on the rest of my body because it came from my swimming; not my lying in the sun without sun protection.  My lovely face was protected because I used to swim underwater so much!In a nutshell, I was a dubious purchaser of this Olay Regenerist line when it first came out and I wouldn't be without it, all these years later.  Oh, and as an aside, I wish my mother, who was a strong proponent of using moisturizer, had told me to put it on the Back of my neck, not just the front.  If she had, I wouldn't have to back out of rooms, as I do today.A note:  I'm still looking for the absolutely perfect moisturizer, forgetting that I'm wearing it.  During a recent special, I ordered a moisturizer that cost $89 a bottle.  I had some samples and after using them for nine days, I decided not to open it when if arrived because I think my Regenerist works far better. Have I learned my lesson?  You bet I have!

  AFTER: This is going to be one of those reviews where you wonder "does this person work for the company selling this product??" but I can assure you I don't have anything to do with them... I just love their moisturizer.  I have been using this for several months after purchasing it at a local big box store.  I have found other moisturizers to either be too greasy (leaving me with a shiny face) or too scented or too thin.  Some of them haven't "rubbed in" well and I find I have little white spots on my face later.This, to me, is the perfect moisturizer.  It has just a faint faint faint smell of something (Oatmeal?) very nice.  Just a little whiff that is one part Elmer's glue and 10 parts water and 10 parts oatmeal.  I know that doesn't sound that appealing but trust me, it's a nice scent.  It rubs in right away and leaves your face feeling really refreshed.  I fly a lot for work and often use this in the morning before a long flight.  I'm surprised well into a long (14 hour) flight how moist my face still feels.  So it lasts.You can read my other reviews and see I don't give out 5 stars very often...but I really like this product and highly recommend it.  I just ordered the same moisturizer with 15 SPF which sounds like an improvement on an already perfect moisturizer.

Problem with Olay is they have just too many different creams, lotions and potions and a lot of them don't have SPF in it, you're not sure whether you should use it as night, day or inbetween treatment just confusing!

  AFTER: The first time I tried the soap I was very surprised by it. When you open the box the bar comes in (even before) you get that wonderful soapy smell, one that brings back good memories for me. It's a fresh clean smell and I like that. Using it I was very happy with how well it lathered up and rinsed off. I didn't feel like I had that soap residue still on my skin. But I was still a little leery. I was sure my skin was going to feel dry and rough when I got done.Boy was I wrong!!After washing my face (and then I used it on my whole body) I felt great. My skin was not just clean, but it felt moisturized like I had used a moisturizing body wash. It was clean, fresh, smelled great and soft! My mind has been completely changed about using soap. Time and time again it has worked very well and feels great using.I really believe it is because of all the minerals from the Dead Sea that are in it as well as the palm oil it is made with. The combination makes the Dead Sea Salt Moisturizing Soap something that will gently clean and keep your skin feeling and looking great. I love this soap and think you will too!I received a sample of the product for review. All opinions expressed though are my own!!

  AFTER: I am disappointed with this one.....it goes on very heavy....even after I wipe the brush down. I wouldn't even dare to layer it on 2 or 3 times as many others do. I like fluffy, light, separated looking lashes and this one isn't doing it for me :( The only thing I like about this item is that the brush has a flat end that is good to use as a liner on the bottom lashes, I like to smudge it.UPDATE: so I have been using this one for  couple of months and I guess it dried out a bit,.....it goes on much better now....I can even sometimes manage fluffy, natural looking, non-clumpy lashes ....so.....it gets better with use :)  The sad thing is-this mascara is very hard to remove. Unless you have a very very good cleanser, you gonna have to use eye makeup remover afterall to make sure that you get it all off.....don't like loosing my lashes :) I am going to leave the rating at 2 stars still. I am going to try another mascara once I use up this one.

It does feel good on the skin and does moisturize, and has a very slightscent, very, very, I should say, because I would have liked a little more.

  AFTER: I like this product combine with an anti wrinkle cream it works well or with the anti wrinkle patch. Ok, this product you must be careful with to much pressure on the eye area will hurt.  So roll lightly.  It is like a little meat tenderizer that allows the cream, lotions, serum etc., to penetrate theskin so you will get faster results.  I liked it but stopped using it after a week, so I only gave it three stars.  But now that i am writing this review i will start using it again tonight.  Happy rolling!

  AFTER: I am delighted with this body wash; it foams well, provides a clean feeling, has a subtle delicate scent and, best of all, really moisturizes! I have very dry skin and it's for the first time in a long, long while that I feel my skin softer and more hydrated. I use the body wash in conjunction with Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion and the results are very good. I have no idea what "colloidal oatmeal" is, but is seems to work, and that's good enough for me! Oh, and I only need to use a small quantity, so it's definitely worth the money.

  AFTER: Like another reviewer, I also have weird eyelashes, my right lashes curl down over my eye, but my left side is just fine.Every mascara I've tried in the past has just pulled the curl right out of my right lashes and down go my lashes over my eye, very annoying.I bought this based on the rave reviews, it shipped literally the next day so I tried it out, didn't expect much, but to my surprise my lashes held a curl! They didn't curl back down over my eye. My lashes on both sides also had length they never had before, but not fake stiff looking length. Also no flakes, no clumps and I didn't have to scrape it off at the end of the day, it came off like nothing with just a little eye make up remover.SO happy with this mascara, I finally found a winner.

  AFTER: Overall, I felt this nail polish was good quality for the price. However, it was not exactly what I expected for a few reasons:(1) COLOR - From looking at the photo of the bottle, I thought this polish would be pink.  However, the color is actually silver with just a slight pink/purple tint.(2) TRANSPARENCY - The polish much more transparent than I thought it would be.  Therefore, I had to put on 3-4 layers to get a nice thick layer of glitter.  However, if you are looking for something that does not overload the sparkles, this polish may be for you.

  AFTER: Everyone's got a clump-free mascara these days, but most don't live up to their advertising.  This one actually does.  The well-designed brush has a curve that allows easy swiping of both upper and lower lashes without a single eye-poke.  That's key.  Many makers have tried brush shapes that, while they apply a lot of product, sometimes without clumps and sometimes with just a few small ones, there's either a poke factor or an angulation that's hard for even the most deft to achieve, let along arthritic older types like me.  This is easy, the product covers nicely with little effort, and there are no gyrations involved in application.  Until something better comes along, I'll call this the Best of Show.

I have very dry skin and this gets the job done.You do not need much of it to fully moisturize.It lasts all day.Mild smell.High Quality.The only downside is this will cost you a bit more than the competitors.

  AFTER: I received this product to review, all opinions are 100% my own.  I honestly normally use body wash because bar soap is so drying.  I was skeptical that a bar soap would be moisturizing.  I will say this soap has a very clean pleasant scent. I made my skin feel very good, not drying at all.  In fact the opposite was the case.  If you want a bar soap that is moisturizing this is for you!  I would recommend this to everyone.

  AFTER: I really love the size of the stick, and that it isn't gloppy and chunky like most mascaras that claim to have lengthening &#34;doll&#34; capabilities. I also LOVED how it worked for the first week of using it, but it dried out very quickly. I will add something to it to see if it brings it back to life. I'd like to try it again, as I really LOVED it at first.

  AFTER: I love using jamaican black castor oil for a number of health & beauty purposes. Mainly, I use it (lightly) to moisturize my scalp post-shampoo. I also use it as a pre-shampoo deep conditioner along with some wheat germ oil and coconut oil. Aside from hair, a light dab moisturizes my face and skin. In the winter months, I apply some lightly to my lips for moisture and to fight chap. Oddly enough, this particular brand has been reported as having a &#34;smoky smell&#34; but I do not find it offensive. Maybe it could be the amount other apply??? To combat this, one could add essential oils like Lavendar.

  AFTER: This oil is sooo thick. I do not seal my ends with this because it makes my hair so heavy. I only use this on my hairline. I also have mixed this with coconut oil and put it in an applicator bottle to grease my scalp. I only apply this 1 or 2 times a week because it is so thick.

  AFTER: Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap is very nice. It has a light floral scent that is strong when it is taken out of the box, but doesn't overwhelm your senses after it is used. The soap creates a rich lather without much effort. It rinses easily and I didn't notice any lingering soap residue. My skin felt clean and smooth. Looking at it in the mirror after a shower it appeared firm and refreshed. This is a soap I can use daily and still feel it provides enough moisture. Overall a great product.I received a free sample in exchange for my honest review.

I am big on waterproof the fusion lasts better and gives a bit more volume and is water resistant, which is not up to my holy grail mascaraBenefit Cosmetics BADgal Lash Mascarabut does add a bit more staying power. clump crusher will stay well, but don't get caught in the rain.

  AFTER: Bought this because I wanted to replace Too Faced Lash Injection Pinpoint since its become so hard to find and dries out too fast for the price. The mascara itself is great but I don't get the brush (sort of a curvy hourglass shape--why??). This might just be me because I've been using the incredibly shallow bristles of the pinpoint mascara for years and I like to work in my mascara a little thicker at the base of my lashes instead of bothering with eyeliner most days. I find it very difficult to apply this evenly without a few smudges on my eyelids. It CAN be a little spidery.Best aspect: it doesn't smudge or run when my eyes water, when I yawn a billion times a day, when I sweat or when my skin gets oily. It does smush in a gooey way if I cry and rub my eyes, but that's much better than flaking or running. I live in Savannah, Georgia and it has no trouble with the humidity. I've also slept in it a few times without it smudging or running at all, which is amazing.

They didn't curl back down over my eye. My lashes on both sides also had length they never had before, but not fake stiff looking length. Also no flakes, no clumps and I didn't have to scrape it off at the end of the day, it came off like nothing with just a little eye make up remover.SO happy with this mascara, I finally found a winner.

  AFTER: All Adovia products are made in Israel. Whenever possible, I prefer to purchase products made in Israel. Dead Sea Minerals are long believed to hold beneficial and/or healing properties. Salt (and sugar) scrubs are a fabulous way to exfoliate your skin without using harsh chemicals. Adovia&#8217;s Dead Sea Salt soap is using salt as a gentle and natural way to slough off dead skin cells revitalizing your skin.I personally LOVE using sugar scrubs to exfoliate my lips prior to applying lipstick (especially matte lipsticks). I truly have enjoyed using this Dead Sea Salt Soap. I&#8217;m fairly picky when it comes to bars of soap that I&#8217;ll use on my body as I once had a doctor tell me that using Ivory was contributing to my itchy skin. He recommended that I ONLY use Dove which is milder and much more moisturizing. Amazingly this soap didn&#8217;t irritate my skin either.I like to exfoliate before shaving (my legs) as I&#8217;ve heard it helps to achieve a closer shave. I also like the how soft and supple frequent exfoliating leaves my skin. So if you are looking for a relatively inexpensive exfoliating bar of soap then I highly recommend that you check out Adovia&#8217;s Dead Sea Salt Soap.

  AFTER: After reading so many great reviews and a few bad ones, I wanted to give this cream a try and see how it worked for me.  Its a very rich, thick cream that feels like it really moisturizes without leaving residue nor an oily feeling. IT does have a strong perfume smell which is not bad nor too overpowering.  My only complaint was that after a day of wearing it, i broke out.I am hispanic, dark hair, light skin and in my 30s.  My skin is a bit sensitive and I have had acne.  Now, and for the past 6 years or so, I get a random pimple here and there but nothing major.  I do break out when I try new products that aggravate my skin, but that is more like a rash than acne. I think this is what happened when I tried this product.After wearking it about 24-36 hours my face broke out into a dozen or so red bumps and another dozen or so mini pimples. Not regular pimples just tiny tiny whiteheads? When this has happened to me in the past, I just wipe with astringent and it calms down the next day.  Well, I forgot i was trying a new product and reapplied it after and it just got worse instead of better.My friend used it and her skin was fine but she has never had any skin problems. I think that maybe this product is not for those with sensitive skin or are/have been prone to break outs.  I am sure that those that aren't may benefit.  I know my friend benefitted when I told her she could keep it.  She loved the perfume smell. :)

This is not a product for the men folk, unless he's walking on heals from a recent pedicure and has his head wrapped up in a floral towel.There are over 26 Dead Sea minerals contained in the bar.  Also present are zinc, bromide, sodium, calcium, magnesium and palm oil.  The soap can be used on a daily basis without drying out your moisture-challenged skin.We love it.  It's just what we needed!

  AFTER: I was really skeptical when I first bought this item, but hopeful. I have tried everything for my stretchmarks and fine lines under my eyes. I started using the roller on my thighs and on my fine lines and then I would apply my lotion and wrinkle cream when I was done. After a few times of using it....not every day, I have really seen results, especially under my eyes! People have not only noticed, but my skin is also firmer. I would definitely recommend this product in addition to your skin regimen you already have. I wont go without one now!Just an update! Ive now been using the roller for a while now and I have to say Im more than impressed with this product. The stretchmarks on my thighs are now thinner and minimal and I had though they would never get better, because Ive literally tried everything you can imagine. I dont use it every day, but it seems the morning after every use I see one after another improvement. My skin is becoming beautiful before my eyes!

  AFTER: I've had this dryer for about two years, and it held up pretty well during that time.  Recently, it started making a burning smell, and regular cleaning of the lint area hasn't helped, so I figured it was time to replace the unit.I originally bought this Revlon unit here on Amazon since it was rated as a Consumer Digest Best Buy, and it's a decent dryer for the price.  If you have shorter hair that is not too thick, this dryer should be fine.That being said, instead of buying a new one of these to replace my old one, I decided to upgrade to a Sedu brand dryer -- and the difference between the two is amazing.  With this Revlon dryer, it took me at least a good 15 minutes to fully dry my short, thick hair.  The Sedu dryer dries my hair in less than five minutes.If you want a good, mid-priced dryer, than this Revlon works well and will last a long time.  However, if you want a faster drying time, I wouldn't recommend this one.  I didn't know how slow this thing was until I splurged on a more expensive unit.Overall, I would give this Revlon unit 3 1/2 stars.

  AFTER: There are several key things that I look for when it comes to trying a new soap or body wash: scent, lather, how easily it washes off the skin, how my skin feels afterwards (including if my skin feels moisturized or dried out), if I can use it on my face/shave with it and how long the soap lasts. I wasted no time in putting this soap to the test.Scent- This soap smells AMAZING. The best way I can describe the scent is to say that it smells really &#34;clean&#34;. There is something else to the scent (faint floral notes?) but I can not place it. I thought the smell was a little overpowering when I first removed it from the box, but it isn't overpowering as you use it in the shower. It actually makes your entire bathroom smell amazing for hours after your shower. The scent also lingers a little on your skin (not a lot, but enough to be pleasant and make you feel clean).Lather- This soap not only lathers well, but it does so easily. You use very little of the soap when in the shower.How easily does it wash off the skin- Very easily. It does not stick to your skin or make you feel like you have to work to rinse it off.How does my skin feel after using- I feel really clean and smell amazing. The soap does not dry out my skin at all like most soaps do. My skin doesn't necessarily feel moist, but it doesn't feel dry or sore either. It feels soft, clean and healthy.Can I use it on my face/shave with it- Yes! If I use other bar soaps on my face it is peeling and dry when I get out of the shower. I have been using this Adovia Mineral Soap on my face for 2 weeks with no peeling or dryness. It makes my face feel so much cleaner than the facial wash I was using previously. I love it on my face! I have also not had as many breakouts. I have also been using this to shave. Since it lathers so well and is not drying, it makes shaving really easy.How long does the soap last- Well, I have been using this soap for about 2 weeks now. As of now the bar looks almost the original size. You can even still faintly see the Adovia stamp on the bar. It appears that this Adovia Mineral Soap will last for a long time.As you can see, the Adovia Dead Sea Salt Moisturizing Mineral Soap passed all of my tests with flying colors. The soap is currently on sale on Amazon for $11 with free shipping for everyone. I normally would not spend that much on a bar of soap, but this soap is definitely worth trying. I recommend it!

  AFTER: I have thick curly hair that, without a dryer, can take upwards of 4 hours to dry. This hairdryer is the answer. It leaves my hair frizz free, the diffuser dries quickly and evenly. I can usually get my hair totally dry (on high heat, low speed) in 20 minutes or so. The weight is good too, not too heavy.Why three stars then? Well, I had my dryer for a year and it broke. The cord base shot out a spark and small flame and the dryer was shot. Keep in mind I was always gentle with the cord (not wrapping it around and around). I know this is a cheap dryer, but honestly, it seems ridiculous to buy a dryer and only expect to get a year's use out of it. It's wasteful that my 1 year old dryer is now in a dump somewhere.This is a good dryer, and if it were double, even triple the cost, and was better built, I'd be so happy. There's no reason this couldn't be a more sturdy product.

  AFTER: I purchased this from a seller that offers free shipping and the price was something like under $7. Considering that this price is about what I pay at Target or some other similar store, I think it's reasonable. The brush shape is different than any of mine and it works well because it gets those lashes on the inner and outer aspects at the same time you are applying the center. The consistency is dry but this is not a bad thing, it doesn't tend to form big clumps on the brush or your lashes, and you should apply coats in succession as if you are brushing your lashes as this works best. The other thing I love is that it does not give me raccoon eyes thought it washes off completely with soap and water! I have used a lot of mascaras, the worst was Falsies, which was like pure goop. The best "base" mascara is Great Lash because it's very thin and sort of separates lashes for another mascara but alone is not enough for me. So I typically use Maybelline's Soft and something but they are back on the animal testing list. I find that this works close enough and it doesn't have the drawbacks mentioned. I don't have to use my Elf eye make-up pen to remove smeary mascara half-way through work.

  AFTER: I tried this one while hiding out from the world in Crisfield, Maryland for the Christmas-New Year holiday season with my relatives.  I like it a lot!  I am an "Olay" fan anyway, but have also used some other products.  I heard on the TV that the Olay Regenerist line was "the best" or something like that, so here is my story:It has a nice creamy texture.  It goes on your face smooth and it just really feels good going on.  It does have a semi-heavy scent blast that hits you when you put the first smear on, but it is not overwhelming and it seems to disipate quickly.  My preference would be to have it without the scent.  The cream just feels really good going on your face, kind of like putting your face on a cool satin pillow.  The cream soaks in really nice too.  It does not feel like it's going to rub off on the pillow when you hit the bed 5 minutes later like some other creams do.  It also does not feel sticky like some creams do.  After 4 days use on my face and neck, morning and evening, my face and neck feel really nice and soft (silky soft).  I would think (based on my initial results) that this cream would have really nice results when used over an extended period of time.I believe this cream holds its own against the other face products that I use, which include the Victoria Principal line, the Olay line, and the Seacret line (in the malls, from the Dead Sea). (I switch around between the products.)The directions are really hard to read on this 1.7 oz red jar but they say the usual.  They tell you to apply in small circular motions and avoid getting it into your eyes and to rinse with water if you do. (Duh.  A no-brainer.) It also suggests that you focus on areas like the brow and jaw line.  Olay is a Proctor and Gamble product.I think it is also important to tell you that I am NOT one of those 25 year olds who has young skin anyway and is trying to tell you how beautiful my skin is. LOL.  No offense, but the young whippersnappers haven't had time to mess up their skin yet!  I am 60 years old and am very pleased with my skin.  It is equally important to tell you that I did nothing special to my skin until about 4 years ago when I began a regular face cream routine.  Those 4 years have paid off big time, so if you think it is too late or you are to old to bother, that is probably not true.  I have had plenty of compliments on my skin.With all that said, I recommend a good quality face cream, before bed and upon waking.  This (and the other Olay products) seem to be worth your time and money.  When you do your face, include your neck too.  It shows.  Rub it on in small circles, like they suggest, and rub up (not down). Ohhhh, might I also suggest no frowning.  Only laugh lines are allowed :-)

  AFTER: I imagined that when I opened the bottle liquid would be so thick due to reviewers. Now, I believe those reviewers were new to the ideology of castor oil. I'm a Caribbean (Dominica W.I) woman who grew up using Jamaican black castor oil which is thicker than this. It's a good size for the price. But not as thick. So that's the only reason why I gave it 4 stars. Package is good. Smell is authentic castor oil. No issues other than its not that thick so I can tell I will run out fast if I don't mix it with something else.

  AFTER: It doesn't feel oily and it dries in under a minute! It's practically unscented and makes my skin  smooth, soft, and protected. This is the best affordable lotion I have ever found. However it says call poison control if ingested. wtf. The skin is an absorbent organ! Humans can die if their skin comes in contact with poision and absorbs it! So this warning label made me very wary because even if some harmful substance is only present in small amounts in this lotion, there's a chance that there will be build up in my body as I have been using this for years. I'm presently looking for a new body lotion. Any suggestions, fellow reviewers? please leave a comment.

  AFTER: Covergirl Clump Crusher Mascara delivers just what it promises -- there are no gross clumps in the finished look.You can go from daytime to a more dramatic look by layering the mascara on, and there are truly no clumps. Good thing for me, since I usually love to wear lots of mascara but hate those little globs you have to slowly remove with a cotton swab. Especially when you consider the price, this is a really good mascara that delivers just what Cover Girl promises.I will purchase this again, and certainly would recommend it to a friend.

  AFTER: Bought this to use on hair since I was told to try it in replace of my regular castor oil, and I must say that i was not impressed. I was told a lot of good things about what this could do for my hair but I haven't seen anything differently happen in comparison to me using my other hair oils. It was also more expensive than the regular oil for less product.

  AFTER: While I occasionally splurge on Buxom Lash mascara, my tried and true mascaras seem to be the newer series of Cover Girl ones that have come out in the last few years orAlmay One Coat Get Up and Grow Mascara, Black, 0.21-Ounce.  While some folks hate the large brush and tube of these newer ones, I don't mind them, and I love the new bristle brushes that coat without leaving clumps.  I've already had good luck using the regular Lash Blast (the one in the orange tube), but I thought I'd try this new one to see how it works.  I really like it, and it really does leave zero clumps!The curved brush on this also does a nice job of adding a gentle curl to your lashes. The non-waterproof formula stays put, even when my allergies are acting up and my eyes are teary.I bought this in the Very Black color, and it's still natural-looking.Like all Cover Girl mascaras, this also comes off easily, with just some eye makeup remover or face wash and water.  You don't have to tug or pull at your eyes.It's a keeper!

  AFTER: Adovia Moisturizing Mineral soap made my skin feel so soft, and very clean. I really like that Adovia Moisturizing Mineral soap leaves my skin feeling clean without leaving a residue like other soaps I tried before. My skin feels so soft that my husband noticed, and asked me what was I using. I liked it so much that I used the soap on my babies too! Their skin felt so soft, I mean their skin is soft already, but it made their skin feel even softer, and the scent lingered on them for a long time.I recommend Adovia Moisturizing Mineral Soap for any one that has dry, sensitive, or normal skin.Disclosure: I received Adovia Moisturizing Mineral Soap for review purposes. However the opinions expressed are 100% my own based on my experience with the product.

  AFTER: Overall, I felt this nail polish was good quality for the price. However, it was not exactly what I expected for a few reasons:(1) COLOR - From looking at the photo of the bottle, I thought this polish would be pink.  However, the color is actually silver with just a slight pink/purple tint.(2) TRANSPARENCY - The polish much more transparent than I thought it would be.  Therefore, I had to put on 3-4 layers to get a nice thick layer of glitter.  However, if you are looking for something that does not overload the sparkles, this polish may be for you.

It doesn't leave your skin feeling dry or scratchy but left my skin feeling smooth and soft. This soap states it is good for all skin types, which is another plus.

  AFTER: This was recommended as one of the top ten skin products in 2009, and I started using it at that time. I found it was a good skin cream, but my more expensive face cream was much better. I am not a fan of the scent.On recommendations of friends I tried the skin cream again, and within a week I found my skin breaking out at my chin line. I have not had issues with my skin since I was a teenager, some 50 odd years ago. I was aghast. I stopped using the cream, and my skin cleared within a few days.I must add that my daughter uses Olay Regenerist Cream, and she loves it. So, who knows what the problem is with my use. I per used other reviews just now, and found other women have had the same skin issues I have.

  AFTER: I bought this Castor Oil strictly for any hair and skin benefits.  I do not have any scars, or stretch marks to test it on, but I can comment on any hair/scalp and skin benefits.My Hair condition:  Dry, course textured, thick, and color treated hair, (frizzy hair in both humid and dry climates) about an inch longer than shoulder length, with a small patch of itchy dry psoriasis in the back of my head.Facial Condition:  Dry skin, and since moving to the Southwest Desert, a very dry and acrid climate ...even drier skin.  I have reached my sixties, so with age; my skin has become challenging dry.Hair ChallengeMy first test object was my hair and scalp.  I decided not to brush my hair for the very first time ever, before shampooing.  I mixed 1/8 tsp. of castor oil in with a handful of my regular shampoo and lathered up.  I did not think that this could possibly be enough, but according to the other reviews that I had read, "a little tiny bit was supposed to go a long, long way."  My hair lathered up nicely, and then I rinsed.  I noticed four things immediately.1) Lose fall-out hairs were minimal - even though I did not brush my hair out first.2) That small patch of psoriasis was soothed - even though I did not use the medicated shampoo.3) No mats or tangles - even though I skipped the conditioner.4) My wet hair felt good, not slimy, not greasy, not oily, just a healthy hair feeling.I skipped my usual leave-in conditioner, and proceeded directly to the blow drier.Results:My hair dried a little faster than usual, and was incredibly soft, soft like a kitten or a puppy's fur.  My hairstyle finish was not quite as smooth or defined as I prefer, it came out a little too fluffy, but with the addition of a few spritzes of argon oil, the results were perfect.  Another bonus for me was that there were very few hairs left on my roll brush, only 4, or 5, which means that there was no hair breakage.  I usually pull an awful lot more hair off my roll brush when I am finished with the blow dry.  The final positive result was when I was out in the sunlight, my hair had a bit of a healthy, clean shine.  This is unusual for my hair because a thick, course textured head of hair does not generally have that characteristic, only my hairdresser can perform this miracle.Facial Challenge:As I have mentioned earlier in this review, I have very dry skin.  I applied a small amount of the castor oil on my face in the evening.  It is thick, and it is greasy, but this is what my dry skin requires because within an hour or so, the castor oil was completely absorbed.  I decided to lightly coat my face once more before bed.  In the morning, my face was a little dry, not sandpaper dry, as I have experienced in the past, but not that soft suppleness that I was hoping to achieve.  However, my skin texture and color was better and a little more even toned!In the other areas of my face that I have used this oil, I have seen some improvement.  My eyebrows are a little thicker, my lashes are luscious, and where I have been applying the oil nightly around the front fringes of my temple, there seems to be some thickening in some areas.  The little peach fuzz hairs around my hairline have not uniformly thickened in all areas, but I have not been using the oil for that long, and I have noticed that different areas respond at different time rates.  However, whatever improvement that been achieved has completely satisfied what little expectations that I have had in this area.I hope that my review has helped those who share my dry skin, facial, and hair issues.

  AFTER: I don't do anything with a hairdryer except dry my hair (meaning I don't use it to "style" my hair).  This hairdryer does dry hair.  It's not as lightweight as you might think (which is why I bought it).  It's really kind of bulky.  Also, the buttons are too easy to push and located right where you hold the thing, so I'm constantly turning the dryer off when I'm using it..... annoying.  I guess I shouldn't complain too much about a product that didn't cost much.

  AFTER: This oil has a thickness and heaviness and a unique smell. I like to use it in conjunction with other oils to tone down the uniqueness of it's smell.  I like that consistancy that help other oils add moisture to the skin especially in winter weather and season.  Experiment with it and your favorite oils, you just might make a wonderful surprise.Just an update concerning this product; it works and penetrates areas where there is arthritis, you can feel the tingeling--not burning. The smell is easy to cover up so I want to give this additional info that can be so helpful to arthritis sufferers.

  AFTER: This was one of the cheaper NYX mascaras that I wanted to try. I like the other NYX eye products (eyeliners, eye primer, eyeshadow) so i thought I'd give their mascara a try. When I first got this the tube was a lot smaller than what I thought it'd be (not a problem though because I don't blow through mascara like I do other eye makeup. Just thought it's be bigger because if th shape). I also, opened it and looked at the consistancy and it looked very thick so all in all I thought it was gonna be very clumpy and flaky but surprisingly it was not. It actually went on rather smoothly and didn't clump hardy at all. It did a tiny bit but that's because I put about 3 coats on and on the 3rd there was some clumping but not in the first 2. It does build rather well so you can get a more dramatic look. The brush is also pretty neat.

  AFTER: This soap helps to defeat dry skin!  I love this soap and cannot say enough good things about it.  It smells great and rinses clean with no film or residue. It also gently exfoliates your skin.  I started using it on my face but when I saw how much better my skin looked started using it on my whole body.  Let me give you some back story about my skin, it is a dry, flaky, rashy, hot mess.  So when I first tried this soap I wasn't expecting much. After using in once, I noticed the skin on my face wasn't tight feeling like it is when I use my normal soap.  My face was soft and smooth.  So I tried it on the rest of my body, and what a difference it has made! I now longer have to apply lotion continuously all day long. Once and I'm good to go!  Also, I'm not trying to make any health claims or anything.  It could just be coincidence but after using this soap for a week, the eczema on my arms ( that has been there for years) has cleared considerably, and my skin is no longer painfully dry.  If you have skin issues, give this soap a try and see how it works for you. For me it has really made a difference! Thanks Adovia!

  AFTER: So I bought this because I heard it was a great growth aid. I put it on my edges for a few weeks last year and my edges did grow but not as much as I thought it would. So I gave a little to my aunt to try (the little lasted her for MONTHS) , and she loved it! She has been bragging about it and she is def going to buy her own. The oil is very thick but surprisingly it didn't last me that long, because I used it in a few of my hair concoctions. My NOW oils lasted me an entire year but this oil was gone after a few months. Luckily, I gave some to my granny, so she still had some left. So I asked her for it  this year and she gave it to me and I was able to use the rest of it just recently to make a hot oil treatment and to use it on my edges. I love the way it makes my hair look and feel. It is a great oil and it does wonders in hair concoctions, deep conditioners and hot oil treatments. You should def buy this to add to your already existing products. I made a hair concoction last year with a bunch of ingredients and this year I finally decided to use it and my hair had a growth spurt. It was amazing how quickly my hair grew and the Jamaican black castor oil def had a lot to do with it because I had used most of the bottle for the concoction. Jamaican black castor oil + MTG + Essential oils + base oils + mega tek + wild growth oil makes one hell of a growth aid. Thanks for reading.

  AFTER: WOW LOVE THIS HAIR DRYER. I called my stylist and asked her which is the best and gave her a couple choices.  She said Tourmaline Ionic Dryer. You can't beat this hair dryer and as one review from a stylist said she loves it and it is affordable vs. hundreds of $$$'s for the same thing that stylists use.  I use it with a Tourmaline Brush and I have curly hair which frizzes especially at the ends.  The tools it comes with like the finger styler and the round attachment for curly hair and a great dryer for this price is a great buy and I'm glad that it is affordable because not everyone can afford what they need. I'm grateful for the deal I got the day I purchased.  If I don't use my brush iron and wish to only use the dryer and my special brush then all I have to do is put a little pure argan oil on the ends and it smooths out the little friz on the ends.  Should I go curly the attachment is awesome. Helps to make the curls a nice style.  Shipping was on schedule and I'm a very happy customer. Almost forgot to add that you do get more shine as well. 100% happy.

  AFTER: This color is so pretty. It is full of gold glitter mixed with other colors of glitter to make it stunning. It looks really vibrant when looking at it on the brush, but is actually more see through than I was expecting when on the nail. I put on two coats and it is super sparkly, but more translucent than I prefer but love the color anyways. It is not super bold or flashy, a little more subtle. and is a great everyday color without being too bold

  AFTER: I have been doing gel polish on my nails at home for 3 years now and I have used almost ALL the brands (I am not a nail tech). I LOVE the price of this brand, and it wears and goes on just as perfect as all the expensive brands.  I have NO problems with peeling or chipping....maybe that is because I put the product on right.

  AFTER: I have acne scars and sun tan in my face and hands. so I use kojic soap to get rid of my pigmentation scars and sun tan and as this soap really makes my skin super dry, I started using olay regenerist cream for about a week now and my skin is well moisturized and even more as  I am in my mid 30's so started getting winkles and this cream is definitely helping to make it less visible. my skin is sensitive and acne prone and this cream doesn't make me breakout.

  AFTER: There is something wonderful in the peanut shaped wand.  You can use it from so many angles.  The mascara product is very good quality for a great price, it does a very good job of thickening my sparse and thin lashes.  It does not get brittle and fall off or smear.  It does not smell or make eye irritating fumes.  Great product for a very reasonable price.

  AFTER: This is the best hairdryer I've owned!I have long, very thick hair, so I usually only dry my bangs and air-dry the rest; drying and styling my whole head can take more than 30 minutes. This dryer has shortened my drying and styling time to under 10 minutes, fresh out of the shower. It's also lightweight, so my arm doesn't get tired holding it. One thing I wasn't expecting was how great my hair would look and feel afterward; usually, after drying, my hair is coarse and wavy and I have to take a flat iron to it. After using the ionic dryer, my hair is smooth and shiny; no need for the straightener!

  AFTER: I received this product to review, all opinions are 100% my own.  I honestly normally use body wash because bar soap is so drying.  I was skeptical that a bar soap would be moisturizing.  I will say this soap has a very clean pleasant scent. I made my skin feel very good, not drying at all.  In fact the opposite was the case.  If you want a bar soap that is moisturizing this is for you!  I would recommend this to everyone.

  AFTER: The Mineral soap arrived in great condition, in a cute little box.  It is about the size of a regular bar of soap.  My mom was here the day it came, and she said that it smells like ivory.  I thought it just had a strong, soap smell.  I know, imagine that, the soap smells like soap :-).  There is no perfume or fruity like smells, (which, really is to be expected from an all natural soap) and it was very strong. However,  During a shower, the smell is not that strong, and I really like how it smells on your skin.My husband is a carpenter, so he is around dust, dirt, and is sweating for a good part of his day.  I thought he would benefit from this the most. It has been a few days now, and I can feel a difference in my skin, as well as see a difference in my husbands.  His pores on his face and back do not look as clogged and yucky like they usually do,  he scrubs them twice daily, before the new Mineral Soap, and now, with it.  The new soap has clearly made a difference!  You can feel a tightening in the skin almost immediately, before even getting out of the shower. Soap DOES lather on a wash cloth! The bar seems to be lasting a decent amount of time. We have used it quite a bit and there is plenty left! I would most definitely buy this soap in the future, as well as recommend to everyone!

  AFTER: All Adovia products are made in Israel. Whenever possible, I prefer to purchase products made in Israel. Dead Sea Minerals are long believed to hold beneficial and/or healing properties. Salt (and sugar) scrubs are a fabulous way to exfoliate your skin without using harsh chemicals. Adovia&#8217;s Dead Sea Salt soap is using salt as a gentle and natural way to slough off dead skin cells revitalizing your skin.I personally LOVE using sugar scrubs to exfoliate my lips prior to applying lipstick (especially matte lipsticks). I truly have enjoyed using this Dead Sea Salt Soap. I&#8217;m fairly picky when it comes to bars of soap that I&#8217;ll use on my body as I once had a doctor tell me that using Ivory was contributing to my itchy skin. He recommended that I ONLY use Dove which is milder and much more moisturizing. Amazingly this soap didn&#8217;t irritate my skin either.I like to exfoliate before shaving (my legs) as I&#8217;ve heard it helps to achieve a closer shave. I also like the how soft and supple frequent exfoliating leaves my skin. So if you are looking for a relatively inexpensive exfoliating bar of soap then I highly recommend that you check out Adovia&#8217;s Dead Sea Salt Soap.

  AFTER: I've suffered for years from hand eczema and dry winter skin. Nothing I've tried has worked until I used this body wash. I looked for it after I saw amazing results in my daughter's eczema usingAveeno Baby Soothing Relief Cream Wash, 12 Ounce. In her case, we found the new detergent base inDove Bar Soap, Sensitive Skin Unscented, 4 Ounce, 16 Countwas triggering rashes and horrible itching, to the point of bleeding. Other baby washes, such asJohnson's Baby Bath Head to Toe Baby Wash, 28 Ounce (Pack of 2)were drying as well. With the Aveeno cream wash, her skin cleared up almost completely. It also works well as a mild baby shampoo.I've since tried other Aveeno products, includingAveeno Nourish + Moisturize Shampoo, 10.5 OunceandAveeno Nourish + Moisturize Conditioner, 10.5 Ounce, and saw a dramatic improvement in my dry flyaway hair in just three uses. Prior to that I had been using Pantene products and was resigned to having bad hair days.I had thought my dry skin and flyaway hair were just the result of pregnancies and getting older. But these Aveeno products all claim to do what they advertise. For the first time in years my skin is soft and my hair smooth. Even my husband noticed. Amazing :)

  AFTER: Right away when I took it out of the package you can smell such a wonderful scent. It's hard to describe but it was quite strong but not overbearing to where I didn't want to smell it. I actually kept it on my desk for a day and it was pleasant to catch whiffs of it before I used it.I took it in the shower and I loved the smell. The feeling of the soap bar on my skin was nice. There is just always something nice about a product that has minimal chemicals in it. I felt like it didn't leave that nasty soapy residue a bunch of cheap soap bars leave on your skin. I have to constantly apply deodorant throughout the day. I don't have a sweating problem but I my underarm sweat smells a bit. I have tried clinical strength deodorants but they barely work. I have been washing my underarms with this soap and I swear it helps out a TON. I have noticed my underarms don't smell that bad anymore. You know what would be awesome? I could only hope that Adovia comes out with their very own deodorant because I think it would be a big success. I totally recommend this dead sea salt soap bar because it moisturizes your skin. It makes you feel good after using it. I prefer to use this on my body and I also use the dead sea mud soap for my face especially. I think having both bars of soap have been quite beneficial to my skin's health. The benefits of dead sea salt are too great for anyone not to consider adding it to their daily skin care regiment.

  AFTER: Want long, voluminous, non-clumpy lashes? Look no further. This mascara is amazing! I have long lashes already. I wanted something that emphasizes that more and gives a lot of volume. This does exactly that. And the lashes are nicely separated and not clumped together making it look like I have 5 really thick eyelashes. The only thing I dislike is that it's quite difficult to get off, even with using an eyemakeup remover. It's quite a task at the end of the day to get it off completely because I put on many coats.

I'd compare it to Boots No. 7 Volumizing mascara. Unfortunately, there's no &#34;wow&#34; factor. My friends all use Benefit and L'oreal, and Maybelline and get much more definitive results. I guess I've just got to keep searching for my holy grail of mascaras.Thanks for reading!

It does exactly what it says my eyebrows were very thin by me plucking them constantly.  Every night I used BCO to my brows and within weeks my brows were so thick and full that amaze me.  Also with my hair when I did my big chop I started using it every night on my scalp even used it as a hot oil treatment and my hair has grown so much it's a amazing product.

There is a considerable difference in the thickness of my roots and its just a clear when flat ironed. Been trying to drink water and eat healthier too. So it would be all of the above.

  AFTER: I purchased this item to replace an ancient, 1980's-era blow dryer, and based my choice on its excellent reviews. I have to agree, this is an excellent product. I first noticed that even on the highest setting the dryer did not get as hot as my old one. I thought this might be a problem, but actually it is an advantage as it won't burn you if you leave it in one place too long. The volume of air being pushed out of this dryer is far stronger than my old hair dryer, so it dries very fast. I have naturally wavy hair that tends to frizz and I used the dryer to straighten it. Much to my surprise, this dryer not only dried my hair very quickly, it left it very smooth with no frizz. It must be the lower heat with the strong blast of air that works so well. Whatever it is, I highly recommend it!

From there I checked out the Aveeno Moisturizing Body Wash and this also had very excellent reviews. So I purchased both. I am very happy with these products. I used to use Olay Body wash but am now completely in love with these two products. They smell really good and make your skin feel dewy and soft all day. I also love that they contain Sweet Almond Oil, which is very difficult to find in products any longer perhaps because it is an expensive ingredient.

I took a chance, checked with Amazon and bought two of these and became rather faithful for 2 months.... what a difference.... people tell me they can't even tell I have a scar... that is with foundation.. but still the lumpy scarred appearance has softened significantly!

This oil made my hair very coarse, to the point I want to get a perm but I won't because I am trying to be natural.

After a short period of wear it began to flake off and my lash-line became irritated and itchy. This is when I decided it had to go, and I took it off.I've never had an allergic reaction to a mascara so I'm guessing it was due to this product and not an overall sensitivity. I have full lashes, maybe it would be better for somebody with thin lashes, I kinda doubt it though.For a product named clump crusher, and then produced clumps, I mean come on. 1 star. I can't think of a mascara I've liked less.

After removing all makeup at night, I apply a bit to the lashes and lash line. I swear I see a difference - longer, thicker, and darker lashes. And it does not sting the eyes, or cause the slight skin discoloration that Latisse did.

For those who are just starting a nightly moisturizer routine, this cream may be better than the less expensive Nightly Moisturizer.  But, I think I'll switch back.  Both products are excellent.

  AFTER: I usually use this product after I wash my face and before i apply my face products. I roll for a total of 5 minutes around my whole face and I can tell this product works because my skin is brighter the next morning. This product does what it claims. Because it pierces my pores, my skin is able to absorb my skincare products better. Within the past 2 years, ive had bad acne and i FINALLY got it under control but i had so many acne scars that made me want to hide in my house 24/7. I came across this product and began to use it for about 3 weeks and within those 3 weeks, my acne scars were the size of the ball of a ball point pen. Even though it was quite painful, I started to get comfortable using it after the first few days. But within those 3 weeks, I used this product every night after washing my face. Believe in me when i say this product works wonders but you have to be patient and use it for at least 5-10 minutes every night. Good LUcK

  AFTER: I been using this product for one month and it made my hair so thick and full. However it did not grow my hair long yet, but now I have a head full of hair. My hair is much stronger and once again very thick, so thick i couldn't comb my hair. It took me two hours to flat iron my hair today. This oil made my hair very coarse, to the point I want to get a perm but I won't because I am trying to be natural. After i wash my hair and blow dry, I rub a nice amount in hand then rub it on my hair. I put the oil in a squeeze bottle with olive oil and I oil my scalp once every other day.

  AFTER: Well I was hoping this was going to work out ordering this imposter Jamaican Black Castor Oil.  But what I got was plain Castor Oil in a dark brown bottle, can you say rip off. When I opened the bottle I smelled the oil, no smell hum, so I got a clear plastic spoon to compare my cold press Castor oil to this oil and guess what I found out, SURPRISE to me, they are one in the same, I couldn't tell the difference from where one started and the other left off. I wont be ordering from this seller again  BEWARE OF THIS IMPOSTER

  AFTER: NOW solutions oils are great, they have a very decent packaging of the bottles and the oil feels fresh and pure. Castor oil is damn good for hair and I have been using this from childhood. Keeps hair away from pollution and chemicals. Hair appears dark and moisturised. Any castor oil has the same effects I believe.

I no longer have cracked skin with bloody knuckles from the drying paper and soap from washing. Small enough that I can keep one in my desk and one in my purse or backpack.

I started using natural oils last month and the change has been nothing short of miraculous. I will continue with this brand of oil for years to come.

  AFTER: I've become a big fan of Adovia products. This soap bar is another great addition to their line of products. I love this soap bar! It is a solid smooth bar that is a decent size and has lasted me for over a week now. It doesn't leave any weird film or residue on my skin. It actually moistures my skin and makes it feel so smooth! It makes me feel clean after without drying out my skin. It does have a very light nice scent to it that is not overwhelming in any way. It lathers well.  On top of all of that, it's infused with 100% dead sea salts which benefits your skin. Makes me feel so luxurious using it. I would highly recommend!

  AFTER: The most I had ever spent on a mascara was about $6 and never ended up being happy with my lashes. I've tried all sorts of brands that promise volume, curl, length ect, but I guess I was never to surprised with my outcome considering the price. Despite that, I could never see spending $20 or more on a tube of mascara that would only last me maybe 6 months, and worst yet, what If I spent the money and still ended up dissapointed. I bought the NYX Doll Eye Mascara on a whim, but it turned out to be the best mascara choice I've ever made.I always start out curling my lashes with a revlon metal lash curler. Usually my lashes don't hold a curl, once I apply mascara there back to their usual straight selves after drying. With the NYX Doll Eye, my lashes held a perfect curl all day. My lashes also looked ALOT longer and I have pretty long eyelashes to begin with so the result was very dramatic.The first time I used this, I only applied one coat and was very happy with the results, minimal clumping but the formula is thick enough to coat each lash nicely, perfect dark black color, shiny and noticable. Since I only wear eye makeup I want my eyes to stand out and mascara is my favorite for this.The second and third time I experimented with more layers. If your going to put on multiple coats I would recommend not waiting in between coats for it to dry. If you do this the result is clumps and messy looking lashes. After curling, I applied a few coats ( the brush holds alot of the mascara on it so unless you wipe of the brush before applying you may not need more on the brush for 3 or 4 coats ) angling the brush to fit in with my lashes which adds volume and oomph because of the way it is shaped. I used to prefer the spoon brush ( for extra curl ), but this style brush gets every lash just right and it is fatter at the ends where your lashes are the shortest and sparse and really plumps them up. The result of 4 coats were beautiful "baby doll" lashes which in my opinion looked even better than falsies ( which to me look funny and fake ).If your struggling to decide whether to try this or not, you really should. For the price of only $9 you will not be dissapointed.

  AFTER: Best body wash for moisturizing in the winter. Completely cured my itchy skin from the blasted heater. No heavy scent, the smell doesn't linger past toweling off.

  AFTER: I have tried many many many mascaras. I have been partial to Diorshow for a while (it is the least clumpy.) But it is kind of expensive, so I have been looking for a cheaper brand to wear everyday. Plus, I noticed as I have gotten older (sighhhh) that my lashes aren't as long and full as they were when I was younger. I figured waterproof mascara wasn't helping that, but still needed something that didn't give me raccoon eyes and stayed on all day.This got good reviews and for the price, I figured it was worth a shot!! WOW!!! I looove it!! I took a photo of before and after with no other make up. I tried to get close up so you could see my light-colored fine lashes and how this helped! This is 2 coats (which I don't always need) but wanted to see how this did. It did great! I still use makeup remover to get it off...I figure that oil is never bad for my eye area! ha ha!!I did have to separate a few stuck-together lashes with my pointy tweezers. That was probably due to the fact that I laid on 2 coats too quickly, because I didn't notice sticking this morning when I put it on for work. I doesn't last as long as waterproof mascaras, but my eyelashes don't feel as crunchy either. A VERY good mascara for everyday. And a good one for night time too (with an extra coat!)

  AFTER: Cleansing every morning has become a spa like experience thanks to Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap. I work the Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap into a deep, rich lather and rub in small concentric circles around my face until it is completely covered in the Sea Salt Soap at which point I begin to rinse with cool to warm water until all traces of the soap have vanished.My skin has never felt so clean, and I am being completely honest with you when I tell you that washing my face has never been so pleasurable. I&#8217;ve used liquid face soap religiously for the past 10 years, at least, not a bar soap, but I am loving the results I&#8217;m getting from Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap. I used to only wash once per day, in the morning, because the liquid soap left my face feeling dry and tight, but with Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap, I wash morning and night.There is never a residue with Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap and my face feels refreshingly clean. Adovia&#8217;s bar soap lather is very light whereas the liquid soap I&#8217;d been using felt like there was always a layer left on my skin. I hadn&#8217;t noticed that leftover residue until I switched to Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap and I don&#8217;t think I will go back to a liquid cleanser again.The price point is right up my alley. At $11 a bar, I feel like I am getting this cleanser at a steal. Compared to other bar soaps I&#8217;ve used in the past as a cleanser, I don&#8217;t feel that they lathered as well or left me feeling as fresh and clean as Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap.Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap also has an amazingly clean fresh scent that you can smell before you even take it out of the box. I love awakening my senses to the smell of Adovia&#8217;s Dead Sea Salt Soap in the morning. It makes me feel like I am doing something good for my skin and feeling good in my skin couldn&#8217;t come at a better price.

  AFTER: First let me start off by letting you know about some of the key factors of this soap.- Infused with 100% Pure Dead Sea Salts from the Dead Sea- Dead Sea Salt Contains over 21 Minerals Key to Skin Health and Beauty- Deeply Moisturizing and Hydrating Soap great for Dry and Normal to Dry Skin- Dead Sea Minerals Essential to Skin Function Contained in the Soap Include Magnesium, Potassium, Sodium, Zinc and More.- Great Value and Benefits for A Daily Moisturizing Facial CleanserI have recently shared reviews of other products from this particular brand. I really like the fact that when I am using these products I can see a difference in my skin. With this soap my skin really felt clean, smooth and nourished after washing.I feel like Adovia prides themselves on making quality products for women who are looking for quality and results in the beauty products that they purchase. I am also very interested in the fact that they use minerals and salt from the Dead Sea.Adovia Moisturizing Mineral Soap comes in a sleekly designed box weighing 4.4 oz. It is a very decent sized bar of soap that will last most women a long time. Because the product actually works and makes my skin feel amazing I feel it is definitely worth the price ($11) because it lasts so long you only have to splurge on it every now and then.I would recommend this line of products to any woman that wants to keep their dry, or normal to dry skin clean, nourished and refreshed.

  AFTER: I received a full tube of Clump Crusher Very Black by Cover Girl Cosmetics to review for the Amazon Vine program. In my 56 years, I've used a lot of mascara:  different colors, different brands, expensive-to-cheap, curling, thickening, waterproof, etc., etc., etc.  For years, I used my favorite, a mascara by Lancome.  It is no longer made.  For the past five or so years, I've been searching for a replacement that is as good as Lancome's product.  I think I've found it.  Clump Crusher (which is a name a teenager would have come up with!) works beautifully from application to removal.  Application is easy, pull the applicator out of the tube and brush it on upper and lower lashes.  Since the applicator is curved, you need to apply it "with" the curve, not against it.  The applicator doesn't get all clumped up with eyelashes and mascara--it stays clean, somehow.  As I apply the mascara, I can see that the product is lengthening my eyelashes, and I am impressed with how separated my eyelashes remain.  No clumps, no spiky lashes with blunt ends, no globs on the lower lashes, just nice separation and length.  I have been using a prescription product to lengthen and thicken my eyelashes (Latisse), and Clump Crusher brings my "new eyelashes" to deliciously-long proportions.  How wonderful!  The product stays on all day.  No flakes, no raccoon eyes, no smudges underneath my lower lid.  When it is time to wash it off at the end of the day, it rinses completely with water and a washcloth.  I'm not left with dark residue under my eyes or on my pillowcase after a good night's sleep.  The case is a fairly obnoxious lime green, but it fits in my rotating make-up organizer on my vanity, so I can't ask for much more than that.  The mascara's SUPER and the Cover Girl (vs Lancome) price is awesome.  I recommend this mascara to those who like lengthening and separation.

I can't wear a lot of commercially produced eye makeup--only NYX Doll Eyes and this won't leave me with itchy, runny eyes.It's also very natural looking and goes well with auburn hair.  It doesn't flake off over the course of a long workday.  You can even nap in it, and it won't leave racoon eyes.I think it's my new favorite mascara.

  AFTER: All Adovia products are made in Israel. Whenever possible, I prefer to purchase products made in Israel. Dead Sea Minerals are long believed to hold beneficial and/or healing properties. Salt (and sugar) scrubs are a fabulous way to exfoliate your skin without using harsh chemicals. Adovia&#8217;s Dead Sea Salt soap is using salt as a gentle and natural way to slough off dead skin cells revitalizing your skin.I personally LOVE using sugar scrubs to exfoliate my lips prior to applying lipstick (especially matte lipsticks). I truly have enjoyed using this Dead Sea Salt Soap. I&#8217;m fairly picky when it comes to bars of soap that I&#8217;ll use on my body as I once had a doctor tell me that using Ivory was contributing to my itchy skin. He recommended that I ONLY use Dove which is milder and much more moisturizing. Amazingly this soap didn&#8217;t irritate my skin either.I like to exfoliate before shaving (my legs) as I&#8217;ve heard it helps to achieve a closer shave. I also like the how soft and supple frequent exfoliating leaves my skin. So if you are looking for a relatively inexpensive exfoliating bar of soap then I highly recommend that you check out Adovia&#8217;s Dead Sea Salt Soap.

  AFTER: I've had this for nearly 3 years. In that time, almost half of the silver paint has flaked off the handle and nozzle.  I had to do a paint check of my hair after each use so it didn't look like I had silver dandruff.  Even though the buttons are down the anterior side of the handle I find that if you use your left hand, you will repeatedly change your settings or turn off the unit all together.  The unit gets super hot, that can be a plus or a minus - depending on your hair type. I have fine hair, so this dryer burns and fries my hair.  The positive is that is is very light.  Check my other reviews, I recently replaced this Revlon with a Conair that is superior in every regard except weight

  AFTER: This Just Gel polish would not cure properly and smelled strongly of solvent. Apparently someone who had the bottle before me attempted to thin it with remover or nail polish thinner. Pure gel polishes shouldn't have a strong odor and even though I understand dark colors can be trickier and take longer to cure, they should still cure after a reasonable time to the same glossy, hard finish as any other gel polish color. Mine left a thick film of uncured, pigmented polish, and the part that cured was dull and porous. I had the same problem with some clearance Gelishes from Sally Beauty. I was new to gel polishes at the time and imagine my frustration trying to get them to work!I will still buy this product again, because it's obvious the one I got was defective or tampered in some way.Purchased from Beauty Chain, who immediately approved the return, though I still need to research how to legally ship back a nail polish containing a flammable substance.Update 2014-02-22: Amazon (not BeautyChain) credited me for the purchase after I explained the dilemma, and they didn't require me to mail it back.

  AFTER: OK I have always been a product junkie, spending too much on creams and lotions of all sorts. Never thought to use something as simple as an oil. I feel like I have just come across a gold mine! I initially purchased the product for my man once I read about its benefits in reversing baldness. As I researched a little more, I found many more advantages such as longer and thicker lashes and brows, tightening and softening skin, eliminating wrinkles and stretch marks, removing callouses and warts and other fungal infections, treating acne, shinier healthier hair....etc. So far I have only used it for a couple of days, and I am already blown away. The softening effect on my skin is nothing like I have ever experienced. Never again will I spend money on expensive face creams. Granted, the oil is a little on the thick side, so a little goes a long way. But if you put a couple of dabs around the eyes and massage them on your wrinkles before bed and very little before you go out, you will see the effects almost immediately! I also bought almond oil (since now I am believer in the miraculous powers of oil) just to mix it with since it has a much lighter consistency, and also high benefits to the skin.Another amazing effect is on my callouses on the soles of my feet, as I run a lot. Absolutely better than any foot cream I've ever used. I massage it in nightly and wear socks right before bed. Instant gratification! Been using it on my stretch marks too around my butt, and I already see changes!All I can say is stop spending money on name brands and go for the source. You will not be disappointed!

  AFTER: ok....heres the thing...im indian mixed with black.....i have 3b/3c type hair.  Now i love this hair dryer.  I have an issue witth frizz, obviously because of my looser curl pattern, particularly with the front of my hair.  normally i dry my hair turban style with a cotton t shirt, but i find myself pressed for time lately.  i heard about this product and decided to give it a try.  and it is definitely worth the money, and space lol.  It left my hair less frizzy (i've come to terms that there will always be some friz), and silky soft.  had a nice shine to it, just like when i turban it.  now it did shrink my hair a bit, but it added volume and was nice and full, and gave me that cute non frizzy defined curl afro i was looking for.  The diffuser piece its self is actually pretty big, i was like where the hell am i gonna put this lol.  but its worth finding space for.  just a tip to avoid heat damage use it on a low warm setting AND DON'T FORGET YOUR HEAT PROTECTANT because i'm pretty sure no one likes fried hair.  i found the chord to be long enough, at least for me.  i don't ever use the other piece except for when i'm painting to dry things faster, or when i plan on flat ironing my hair, but i'm sure it has its purposes too lol.

  AFTER: Recently I was given the opportunity to review an Adovia's product called their Moisturizing Mineral Soap with Dead Sea Salt and Minerals.  Adovia uses minerals from Dead Sea salt - as well as herbs and oils from all over the world.According to their item descrption it says:Item description:- Infused with 100% Pure Dead Sea Salts from the Dead Sea- Dead Sea Salt Contains over 21 Minerals Key to Skin Health and Beauty- Deeply Moisturizing and Hydrating Soap great for Dry and Normal to Dry Skin- Dead Sea Minerals Essential to Skin Function Contained in the Soap Include Magnesium, Potassium, Sodium, Zinc and More.- Great Value and Benefits for A Daily Moisturizing Facial CleanserFor budgetary reasons, I normally use some of the more popular drug store facial cleansers, but I've never really felt that they do a great job of cleaning my skin. I was pleasantly surprised by the mineral soap.  Normally people shy away from bar soaps due to their bad rep.  A lot of soaps contain lye which is totally horrible for your body and causes serious dryness.  Their are a few soaps out there made without lye, but their are far few and between.  Hence why body washes became so popular a few years back.  You were able to put in skin softening ingredients without the harsh chemicals needed and clean and condition the skin at the same time.However this soap was really surprising.  It isn't harsh and contains more natural ingredients than the slew of unreadable chemical names that you'll find on the box of any cleanser at your local drug store. The soap didn't lather as much, but that is given the fact that it lacks all those unnatural ingredients needed in order to get that result.  My skin does feel a bit cleaner than normal and combined with a face exfoliator it's even better.  Also it leaves your skin feeling hydrate since its all natural so you don't get the tight skin feeling that you normal have after using soap on your face or body.  In addition, it's great for washing away make up residue that may have gotten left over by your makeup remover.  I would say this soap is really gentle to use everyday and the fact that it's natural really makes it noteworthy.Adovia so far has surprised me with their all natural products by really giving me wonderful results!

  AFTER: I've become a big fan of Adovia products. This soap bar is another great addition to their line of products. I love this soap bar! It is a solid smooth bar that is a decent size and has lasted me for over a week now. It doesn't leave any weird film or residue on my skin. It actually moistures my skin and makes it feel so smooth! It makes me feel clean after without drying out my skin. It does have a very light nice scent to it that is not overwhelming in any way. It lathers well.  On top of all of that, it's infused with 100% dead sea salts which benefits your skin. Makes me feel so luxurious using it. I would highly recommend!

  AFTER: I use a lot of natural oils, and castor oil is a regular player. Keep in mind it can be drying on its own so it needs to be mixed with a carrier oil-I use sweet almond oil and put a few drops of lavender oil in as well. It is a little thicker than some oils but once mixed it is fine. I can already see my over-plucked eyebrows growing back and plan on using it as a hair/scalp treatment as well. I noticed some have complained about the smell, but I have barely noticed it-sort of a light nutty smell. Just mix a few drops of essential oil in and you can have whatever scent you want. Lavender oil is also good for hair growth so I use that.

  AFTER: The first time I tried the soap I was very surprised by it. When you open the box the bar comes in (even before) you get that wonderful soapy smell, one that brings back good memories for me. It's a fresh clean smell and I like that. Using it I was very happy with how well it lathered up and rinsed off. I didn't feel like I had that soap residue still on my skin. But I was still a little leery. I was sure my skin was going to feel dry and rough when I got done.Boy was I wrong!!After washing my face (and then I used it on my whole body) I felt great. My skin was not just clean, but it felt moisturized like I had used a moisturizing body wash. It was clean, fresh, smelled great and soft! My mind has been completely changed about using soap. Time and time again it has worked very well and feels great using.I really believe it is because of all the minerals from the Dead Sea that are in it as well as the palm oil it is made with. The combination makes the Dead Sea Salt Moisturizing Soap something that will gently clean and keep your skin feeling and looking great. I love this soap and think you will too!I received a sample of the product for review. All opinions expressed though are my own!!

  AFTER: This is my favorite mascara of all time and, coming from a middle schooler obsessed with makeup, I've tried a looot of mascaras. If you are looking for length, this will give you length. Even if your lashes are short and stubby, this mascara will make your lashes look long and luscious. It doesn't do much for volume though so if you are looking to thicken your lashes this isn't that mascara for you. Although I would recommend the NYX doll eye volume waterproof mascara.

  AFTER: This was recommended as one of the top ten skin products in 2009, and I started using it at that time. I found it was a good skin cream, but my more expensive face cream was much better. I am not a fan of the scent.On recommendations of friends I tried the skin cream again, and within a week I found my skin breaking out at my chin line. I have not had issues with my skin since I was a teenager, some 50 odd years ago. I was aghast. I stopped using the cream, and my skin cleared within a few days.I must add that my daughter uses Olay Regenerist Cream, and she loves it. So, who knows what the problem is with my use. I per used other reviews just now, and found other women have had the same skin issues I have. My advice would be for every woman to try it for themselves.PROSEasy To UseImproves Skin Texture on most womenMinimizes WrinklesNoticeable ResultsSoothingCONSFor me and some other women, skin broke out using this cream.Not Recommended For Me.

I was looking for a product that grows and thinkens hair and this JBCO has appeared to deliver. I have also used it on my eyelashes (careful with that though, it can get into your eyes) and seen them grow and on my dry skin and seen it glow (this is best for dry skin, my skin is combo so I can't use it too much on my face, only when necessary). I'm sure there are many wonders untold about this oil, I am still looking.

This is what she says about this great soap.It has a light, but nice fragranceIt has a nice lather that makes her skin feel goodThere is no residue left on the skin like many of the store bought soaps. We also have a water softener which makes this soap last a long time.The soap makes her skin feel softer and healthierWe see an improvement in my daughter's skin. Especially on her legs that get dried and itchy from other soaps.The price is a little expensive, but the soap does the trick and we got to try it for freeWould recommend this soap much more than regular bars of soap

  AFTER: Bought this to blend my own formula to use as a facial cleanser - it's called the European facial oil cleanse method. Castor oil acts as an antibacterial agent in the recipe used to combat breakouts. I'm of French ancestors whose women have used the oil method for generations. We always blend our own recipes customized to each ladies needs. Now brand of castor oil is the purest, clearest, and the  cleanest I've found. Its safe for ingesting, too. It's reasonably priced and shipped quickly. Highly recommend NOW oils and this seller.

My hair is much stronger and once again very thick, so thick i couldn't comb my hair. It took me two hours to flat iron my hair today. This oil made my hair very coarse, to the point I want to get a perm but I won't because I am trying to be natural. After i wash my hair and blow dry, I rub a nice amount in hand then rub it on my hair. I put the oil in a squeeze bottle with olive oil and I oil my scalp once every other day.

  AFTER: When I take my shower I like to use some kind of shower soap gel with a soft bath scrubber loofah. I am not usually a big fan of bar soap. Reading about the ADOVIA Dead Sea Salt Soap and all the advantages it has brought up my curiosity, so I thought I would give it a try. The product uses all natural products and has 21 minerals that are key to health and beauty. That caught my attention.I had little idea how great this product would turn out to be. I was pleasantly surprised! I expected it to be gritty and exfoliating just from the words &#34;dead sea salt.&#34;  It was not at all. The mild scent of the soap was so refreshing. It lathered so nicely on my loofah sponge. I have not tried it on my face, however I am using it as a skin-healthy shave soap for my legs.Unlike any other bar soap that I have used, I really like the way it leaves my skin feeling and its ability to lather and rinse off. ADOVIA Dead Sea Salt Soap you are my new product in our shower. I really was impressed!

Only need a little as castor oil is very thick and sticky. But this bottle has lasted me forever and I highly recommend it.

  AFTER: I guess you can call me a mascara junkie in that I like to try different brands and don't usually stick to one brand for too long.  I also try never to spend more than $10. on any mascara--the way I see it either the mascara works or it doesn't in terms of easy application, longer and thicker lashes, low or no clumpiness.  This mascara fits the bill in all those important respects and sells at a good price.  I have already ordered a second tube, that's how much I like it, I don't want to run out of it.  I give it a "4" though because I don't think it is hypoallergenic, plus it is marked as being made in Korea....I don't know what the standards are for makeup in other countries.Several months later, I found that every time I wore this mascara my eyes would have a burning sensation which I never had with other mascaras.  Sure enough, I switched to other mascaras and the burning sensation stopped.  Nervous about the ingredients now so wouldn't use it again.

  AFTER: I love using jamaican black castor oil for a number of health & beauty purposes. Mainly, I use it (lightly) to moisturize my scalp post-shampoo. I also use it as a pre-shampoo deep conditioner along with some wheat germ oil and coconut oil. Aside from hair, a light dab moisturizes my face and skin. In the winter months, I apply some lightly to my lips for moisture and to fight chap. Oddly enough, this particular brand has been reported as having a &#34;smoky smell&#34; but I do not find it offensive. Maybe it could be the amount other apply??? To combat this, one could add essential oils like Lavendar.

It might be cute over the top of the Mischievous Mango color though.  IBD as a brand though is great.  Long lasting, goes on smooth, and the bottle design doesn't make a huge mess like the Gelish does.  Who doesn't like being about to buy 2 colors for the price of 1 of the other brands too!?

  AFTER: 1/31/13 UPDATE: I have been using this mascara in Very Black (rather than Brown) and I have upgraded my opinion from 4 to 5 Stars. This is a very good, well priced, every day mascara that is easy to apply, dries quickly and gives one's lashes moderate volume and length.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I am quite specific in my mascara preferences and I usually don't care for curved brushes. This brush, however is excellent. Shaped like a smile or a wedge (thicker in the center and tapered at the ends), the brush is composed of many short plastic spikes that move easily through the lashes while depositing lots of pigment at the lash roots. The shape of the brush allows for quick and even application even at the more difficult to reach areas: the inner and outer corners, the lower lashes. It is because of this innovative brush that I would recommend this mascara overCoverGirl Lashblast Mascara, Very Black 800, which is a very good, everyday product.This  mascara is smooth and somewhat glossy in Brown and matte in Very Black. It applies evenly without much clumping as long as you kept the brush moving. "Build-ability", the ability to apply multiple coats one over the other was not a problem as long as the mascara had not dried fully. Once dried, the mascara would clump somewhat when a fresh coat was applied.....not terrible but not exactly what I would call a "Clump Crusher" either. My current favorite "dime store" mascara isL'Oreal Paris Voluminous Million Lashes Mascara, Blackest Blackand I can apply it in the morning before work and then at 7 pm reapply a coat for a more dramatic effect before going out to dinner. You also can do this with "Clump Crusher", but not with the same voluminous effect.This mascara comes in four shades: Very Black, Black, Black Brown, and Brown. I originally tested the Brown which I found to be extremely, surprisingly light in color, even lighter than my normal lashes. I would only recommend the Brown for extremely fair, light blondes or perhaps strawberry blondes with pale, pale lashes who are interested in a casual, natural look. Otherwise, for anyone else, I would not go lighter than the Black Brown.This mascara is an excellent choice if you are interested in natural looking lashes with moderate volume and length.

  AFTER: There are several key things that I look for when it comes to trying a new soap or body wash: scent, lather, how easily it washes off the skin, how my skin feels afterwards (including if my skin feels moisturized or dried out), if I can use it on my face/shave with it and how long the soap lasts. I wasted no time in putting this soap to the test.Scent- This soap smells AMAZING. The best way I can describe the scent is to say that it smells really &#34;clean&#34;. There is something else to the scent (faint floral notes?) but I can not place it. I thought the smell was a little overpowering when I first removed it from the box, but it isn't overpowering as you use it in the shower. It actually makes your entire bathroom smell amazing for hours after your shower. The scent also lingers a little on your skin (not a lot, but enough to be pleasant and make you feel clean).Lather- This soap not only lathers well, but it does so easily. You use very little of the soap when in the shower.How easily does it wash off the skin- Very easily. It does not stick to your skin or make you feel like you have to work to rinse it off.How does my skin feel after using- I feel really clean and smell amazing. The soap does not dry out my skin at all like most soaps do. My skin doesn't necessarily feel moist, but it doesn't feel dry or sore either. It feels soft, clean and healthy.Can I use it on my face/shave with it- Yes! If I use other bar soaps on my face it is peeling and dry when I get out of the shower. I have been using this Adovia Mineral Soap on my face for 2 weeks with no peeling or dryness. It makes my face feel so much cleaner than the facial wash I was using previously. I love it on my face! I have also not had as many breakouts. I have also been using this to shave. Since it lathers so well and is not drying, it makes shaving really easy.How long does the soap last- Well, I have been using this soap for about 2 weeks now. As of now the bar looks almost the original size. You can even still faintly see the Adovia stamp on the bar. It appears that this Adovia Mineral Soap will last for a long time.As you can see, the Adovia Dead Sea Salt Moisturizing Mineral Soap passed all of my tests with flying colors. The soap is currently on sale on Amazon for $11 with free shipping for everyone. I normally would not spend that much on a bar of soap, but this soap is definitely worth trying. I recommend it!

  AFTER: I don't do anything with a hairdryer except dry my hair (meaning I don't use it to "style" my hair).  This hairdryer does dry hair.  It's not as lightweight as you might think (which is why I bought it).  It's really kind of bulky.  Also, the buttons are too easy to push and located right where you hold the thing, so I'm constantly turning the dryer off when I'm using it..... annoying.  I guess I shouldn't complain too much about a product that didn't cost much.

  AFTER: I purchased this item to replace an ancient, 1980's-era blow dryer, and based my choice on its excellent reviews. I have to agree, this is an excellent product. I first noticed that even on the highest setting the dryer did not get as hot as my old one. I thought this might be a problem, but actually it is an advantage as it won't burn you if you leave it in one place too long. The volume of air being pushed out of this dryer is far stronger than my old hair dryer, so it dries very fast. I have naturally wavy hair that tends to frizz and I used the dryer to straighten it. Much to my surprise, this dryer not only dried my hair very quickly, it left it very smooth with no frizz. It must be the lower heat with the strong blast of air that works so well. Whatever it is, I highly recommend it!

  AFTER: This lotion does what it says.  It's really, really moisturizing and soothing for dry winter skin.  I've got a few dry patches that only Aveeno seems to be able to sort out.  It is absolutely unscented, as well.  I don't tend to like unscented lotions, so I add some perfume oil to mine, and it still works really well.  This is absolutely essential for me in the winter.

  AFTER: I wasn&#8217;t quite sure what to expect from the Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap. And I thought it would be gritty and exfoliating, but it wasn't it is a very soft soap. The scent lingers on your skin but is not at all overpowering. It&#8217;s a very pleasant and clean scent. Since the scent is pretty much a clean neutral scent men can use this product. The soap is smooth and lathers beautifully. There&#8217;s nothing gritty or rough about it. It&#8217;s almost like a lotion which is how I like my soap to feel . After a few days of using it I noticed that it cleared up some patches of rough skin and acne that I often get. So often soaps dry out my skin but this one has not done that. It dose not leave behind a  film or residue and my skin feels soft and not dry or rough I&#8217;m very pleased with this soap. Adovia made a great product. The Adovia Dead Sea Salt soap has done all it promised to do, all while leaving a pleasant and clean scent on my skin. This infused soap is one I&#8217;m glad I had a chance to use. The price when compared to similar products, is really reasonable! A lot of these infused soaps cost almost twice what Adovia is selling their product for. This soap is absolutely worth every penny.

  AFTER: All Adovia products are made in Israel. Whenever possible, I prefer to purchase products made in Israel. Dead Sea Minerals are long believed to hold beneficial and/or healing properties. Salt (and sugar) scrubs are a fabulous way to exfoliate your skin without using harsh chemicals. Adovia&#8217;s Dead Sea Salt soap is using salt as a gentle and natural way to slough off dead skin cells revitalizing your skin.I personally LOVE using sugar scrubs to exfoliate my lips prior to applying lipstick (especially matte lipsticks). I truly have enjoyed using this Dead Sea Salt Soap. I&#8217;m fairly picky when it comes to bars of soap that I&#8217;ll use on my body as I once had a doctor tell me that using Ivory was contributing to my itchy skin. He recommended that I ONLY use Dove which is milder and much more moisturizing. Amazingly this soap didn&#8217;t irritate my skin either.I like to exfoliate before shaving (my legs) as I&#8217;ve heard it helps to achieve a closer shave. I also like the how soft and supple frequent exfoliating leaves my skin. So if you are looking for a relatively inexpensive exfoliating bar of soap then I highly recommend that you check out Adovia&#8217;s Dead Sea Salt Soap.

  AFTER: I was nervous to use this because I don't use bar soap. I haven't used one since I can remember. Well I love Adovia products. When I received the product and open the package it was undamaged. I couldn't help but to smell it. The smell was amazing and not to over powering but does have a very clean smell to it. The soap is smooth and lathers perfectly. Its very moisturizing and natural with dead sea minerals. Left me feeling moisturized all day. It didn't even leave my face or body feeling dry. After the shower it has a lingering fragrance which is great. I love smelling good after a shower like you have just got out not like you only washed with water. Its not overpowering either but just very fresh. Loved it made my skin soft to the touch!!!!

  AFTER: Cleansing every morning has become a spa like experience thanks to Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap. I work the Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap into a deep, rich lather and rub in small concentric circles around my face until it is completely covered in the Sea Salt Soap at which point I begin to rinse with cool to warm water until all traces of the soap have vanished.My skin has never felt so clean, and I am being completely honest with you when I tell you that washing my face has never been so pleasurable. I&#8217;ve used liquid face soap religiously for the past 10 years, at least, not a bar soap, but I am loving the results I&#8217;m getting from Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap. I used to only wash once per day, in the morning, because the liquid soap left my face feeling dry and tight, but with Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap, I wash morning and night.There is never a residue with Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap and my face feels refreshingly clean. Adovia&#8217;s bar soap lather is very light whereas the liquid soap I&#8217;d been using felt like there was always a layer left on my skin. I hadn&#8217;t noticed that leftover residue until I switched to Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap and I don&#8217;t think I will go back to a liquid cleanser again.The price point is right up my alley. At $11 a bar, I feel like I am getting this cleanser at a steal. Compared to other bar soaps I&#8217;ve used in the past as a cleanser, I don&#8217;t feel that they lathered as well or left me feeling as fresh and clean as Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap.Adovia Dead Sea Salt Soap also has an amazingly clean fresh scent that you can smell before you even take it out of the box. I love awakening my senses to the smell of Adovia&#8217;s Dead Sea Salt Soap in the morning. It makes me feel like I am doing something good for my skin and feeling good in my skin couldn&#8217;t come at a better price.

  AFTER: It causes me pain, but I like it so far. It leaves my face red, but that means that it works. I&#8217;ve got it in perfect condition (some people here were complaining about it being broken) and so far I&#8217;m happy with it.It&#8217;s painful on some areas more than others (or that&#8217;s just with me), but I guess it depends on pressure as well; pushing it more into skin means more pain, but I might as well since I want to see the full results and take the full advantage of the device. I apply a lotion afterwards and my face is still a little red in the morning. I&#8217;ve noticed fewer scars in just a few weeks. I&#8217;ll see how it goes with this one as far as pain and maybe in a future get the 1.5mm&#8230;.but not yet.

  AFTER: I purchased the needle roller after reading many mixed reviews. Some people swear by its usage while some people find it barbaric and would never even consider using it. I chose to try it as a last resort before undergoing any high cost beauty treatments. I'm in my mid-30's and it seems that when I use beauty products on my face they just sit on top of my skin. I wanted something that was going to help the beauty products penetrate my skin. I've only used the needle roller once and my experience was that while I felt as though I had gotten sunburn, it didn't hurt. It was more irritating than anything. When I used it, I did it before bedtime so that I could let my skin rest a few hours and take in my face product. I do recommend using a face product that is natural and that isn't harsh on the skin. I used an Eminence product which is natural and organic so as to not irritate my skin. I will say that after using the skin roller just one time, my face felt softer and looked much more refreshed than it normally does. I'm pretty sure the roller had something to do with it. So far so good.

It is not only unscented - but doesn't have any fragrance at all which is fantastic - it doesnt even smell like lotion so you can then wear perfume without any clash of scents.  Leaves my skin smooth and super soft.  On a 1-10 scale...this lotion gets an 11.

My hair is much stronger and once again very thick, so thick i couldn't comb my hair. It took me two hours to flat iron my hair today. This oil made my hair very coarse, to the point I want to get a perm but I won't because I am trying to be natural. After i wash my hair and blow dry, I rub a nice amount in hand then rub it on my hair. I put the oil in a squeeze bottle with olive oil and I oil my scalp once every other day.

  AFTER: This mascara separates the lashes well, but it's very stiff going on and hurts my lashes and eyelids when I apply it.

  AFTER: Now Foods does not specify if this castor oil is refined or unrefined, but it is certainly specified as Hexane free and expeller pressed, not cold pressed but in conventional form not organic or USDA organic form. Priced extremely reasonably, it is a good start but with new technologies, I found USDA organic with certification and unfiltered which makes it more expensive but certainly a better choice for me.CO is the most important oil out of handful of oils that I daily as beauty mix. I just put half the amount of shampoo, rub it in my palm to mix the shampoo and the CO, apply it as shampoo every single time. I place some CO directly on my head, scrub the scalp for removal of any residue on hair. Ricinoleic acid in castor oil helps to protect hair and stimulates circulation of nutrient rich blood to scalp. Dry scalp can lead to dandruff but CO's omega-9 fatty acids can help. I leave it for few hours and then wash it off. I place CO directly on my eye brows for hair growth. I mix with VCO since it keeps the mix not only liquid but runny. It is the best mix after shaving. I apply the mix to my whole body before mountain biking without any shirt or pumping iron at the gym. The mix keeps the bees and flies away.  I mix CO with AO to remove dark spots on my skin because of the scabs that I get from mountain biking. I blend CO with few more ingredients to make scrub, shaving cream and sunscreen.Any oil from any nut, seed or grain will go rancid, having no nutritional value shortly after production so I keep all my oils in dark containers, away from any light, air and moisture and use it quickly.

  AFTER: It doesn't feel oily and it dries in under a minute! It's practically unscented and makes my skin  smooth, soft, and protected. This is the best affordable lotion I have ever found. However it says call poison control if ingested. wtf. The skin is an absorbent organ! Humans can die if their skin comes in contact with poision and absorbs it! So this warning label made me very wary because even if some harmful substance is only present in small amounts in this lotion, there's a chance that there will be build up in my body as I have been using this for years. I'm presently looking for a new body lotion. Any suggestions, fellow reviewers? please leave a comment.

Be warned that this oil is thick and sticky (but I don't mind since it does the job).

I love to use this with my Clarisonic because it distributes more evenly than a liquid or cream soap, All I do is dampen the brush dead and than turn it on the bar so it picks up the right amount of product evenly. This face/body bar is very moisturizing and natural with dead sea minerals , its very easy to work with and nose a excellent job of cleaning.

  AFTER: Even though I disinfected with alcohol, I developed strange bumps under the skin on the back of my hands that became infected. My skin developed bumps that wouldn't go away for 3 weeks. This is very cheap and flimsy and there are much better ones out there. I ended up buying the SheEssentials 1 mm with 1.5 mm changeable head, and it was FANTASTIC! I paid a bit more for it, but it's way better quality and has a lot more needles than this did, 600 needles for the smaller head and 1200 needles for the larger one. I'm not sure how many needles this product has, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's 300. This means less skin will get punctured. I definitely saw much better results with the 600 needles. The fact that it came with two heads made the price comparable to this when you factor that in. The double-wide roller was a huge plus for larger areas as I have a lot that I'm treating and trying to roll stomach or thighs with a tiny roller would take days.Dermarolling has been amazing for me. I've had great results with my other dermaroller for stretchmarks and loose skin- in only a few sessions! It has given me hope that I thought I would never have again, when my body changed so rapidly from rapid, extreme weight gain and loss. It's a huge difference on 20 year old stretch marks that I thought would never go away. On my belly it 'raised' old, indented stretchmarks so they can now be healed and exfoliated.Dermarolling has given me so much hope and a lot more pride in myself and I can't recommend anything more strongly. It's definitely worth trying before other, more invasive and expensive measures. But please do your research first and make sure you are getting the best dermaroller for your money. Don't be afraid to pay just a little more for a product that will give you even better results. And please make sure you really research on how often to do it and what mm is best for your area of treatment. Also, just because I experienced such amazing results in such a short time, don't give up if you don't. From what I've researched, it can take several months of repeated treatments before some people see strong results. It depends on your issue, how long you've had it, and how fast your body is able to heal. Also on whether you are doing this correctly, so again I stress- please do very thorough research even if you just want to jump right in. If you don't give your skin time to fully heal, you'll destroy the results you are trying to achieve. You can actually break down the collagen that is trying to form from your last session if you do it again too soon!I hope this review helps anyone interested in dermarolling. I know how important it can be to have a little hope!

  AFTER: I guess you can call me a mascara junkie in that I like to try different brands and don't usually stick to one brand for too long.  I also try never to spend more than $10. on any mascara--the way I see it either the mascara works or it doesn't in terms of easy application, longer and thicker lashes, low or no clumpiness.  This mascara fits the bill in all those important respects and sells at a good price.  I have already ordered a second tube, that's how much I like it, I don't want to run out of it.  I give it a "4" though because I don't think it is hypoallergenic, plus it is marked as being made in Korea....I don't know what the standards are for makeup in other countries.Several months later, I found that every time I wore this mascara my eyes would have a burning sensation which I never had with other mascaras.  Sure enough, I switched to other mascaras and the burning sensation stopped.  Nervous about the ingredients now so wouldn't use it again.

  AFTER: Personally, I like the product.I'm into making my own body salves and hair 'grease/dressing/pomade/cream'(whatever you want to call it).  My current concoction looks like a creamy mousse.  I simply added some of this Tropical Isle Living Jamaican Black Castor Oil (JBCO) to it and I like the results.  Our hair seems to be growing and we've experienced no adverse side effects to date.  Our scalps have not been itchy since applying the product and the stickiness isn't an issue because I added this to a homemade hair grease/pomade (at least 4 capfuls to about 14oz of hair cream.I'm not going to mention all the ingredients, but to give you an idea, my homemade hair creams and body salves are made of natural oils, such as virgin coconut oil, extra virgin olive oil, unrefined avocado oil, jojoba, a few nut oils, true ivory unrefined shea butter(softened by stirring with a fork, NOT MELTED!!), calendula essential oil, tea tree essential oil, myrrh, ylang ylang extra...you get the idea, all natural ingredients.  For the summer only, I added about 6 drops of vegetable glycerine to it to pull moisture out of the air and into our hair.  Don't do that in Winter because the air is dry from the heaters and furnaces being on and it will pull the moisture out of your scalp and the inside of your hair to moisturize the outside of your strand, which will quickly cause damage and breakage.  Vegetable glycerine is great for moisturizing during humid months.Also, I don't get what the big fuss is about the smell.  It doesn't smell good or bad to me and since it's mixed into a hair dressing when I apply it, I don't smell it afterward in my or my daughter's hair.I will say, that I also bought the same brand JBCO Hair food, which has a much more pungeant smell/odor than this oil.  I added some of this JBCO to it as well and applied that to our hair and scalp.  We still don't see what is offensive about the scent and I can barely if at all smell it once it's in our hair.  My suggestion, is that one could add a good essential oil to the bottle to tweak the smell.  I'd only put up to 6 drops though for such a small bottle.  Essential oils are powerful with wonderful benefits but could make you sick if not diluted well.  Always remember that essential oils can be diluted with oil only, so if you spill some or use it too concentrated on the skin or scalp, take coconut, olive, any vegetable or carrier oil will do to clean it off.  Water won't do any good because essential oils are oil soluble.  Wash it off with the vegetable/carrier oil, then wash that off with soap and water.  Another suggestion, is that this brand of JBCO is also sold in scented varieties.  The only one I've seen so far is Lavender.  It's supposedly slightly thinner in consistency, but people seem to like it and it smells good, so the reviews say (I haven't and don't plan on trying it, I'm satisfied with this original).If you're going to add essential oil to this JBCO, I recommend calendula, blood orange, lavender...something with a nice scent.  You could use fragrant oils manufactured exclusively for fragrancing cosmetics/soaps/candles and the like, but I wouldn't go that route unless you can find some made with plant oils and extracts instead of synthetic chemicals and no, I am not talking about body oils that you wear like perfume.  I guess you could but I personally would not.Anyway, I liked the way our homemade hair dressing and the Tropical Isle Living JBCO Hair Food worked before, but adding the JBCO to them seemed to increase the results of what we were looking for:  shine, manageability, softening, sealing and growth.This oil seems fine to me and I plan to buy much more of it.

  AFTER: I really really love everything about this soap, from the way it leaves my skin soft and moisturized to the wonderful smell of it. I am always looking for soap that not only cleans my skin but also leaves it soft, hydrated and doesn't leave a film on my skin. The product met all my requirements! I love feeling like I am treating my skin with spa quality products. The more I learn about Dead Sea minerals the more love this product! I love the fact that Dead Sea salt contains 21 minerals key minerals for skin health and beauty. A must have!Disclosure: I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion.

  AFTER: This size does hurt a bit compaired to the .5 mm however I needed something a bit stronger and its been working out great!  I also like this brand.  I recently purchased a different brand and it wasn't as good.

  AFTER: I received this for review and considering my past experience with Dead Sea Salt I expected nothing less. It is a great moisturizing soap. It is great for face and body. I do not mind the smell although it is a bit strong but it kind of reminds me of clean laundry.

  AFTER: This soap fit easily into the palm of my hand and glides over my skin creating a light, clean, fragrant lather.  It rinses off easily and left my skin with a delightful, healthy glow.Usually after showering I must apply some type of body lotion to my skin to avoid the chalky, ashy look of dry skin.  I didn't apply any lotion after using this soap to test it's hydrating ability.  I was pleasantly surprised that my skin continued to look bright and healthy for over 8 hours.  For me this is Huge.  If there is a way to shave a few minutes off my morning routine, I'm all for it.  I will be purchasing this soap over and over again.
